%\item 
%PU reweighting discussion

%\item 
%Add object performance : mention which performance is relevant to my analysis. 
%Is it important to have a good MET resolution?(In terms of fake MET) 
%Is it important to have good a good muon identification? 

%\item 
%When separating reconstruction and selection, Top-tagging should be should be 
%divided properly. 

%\item 
%Title of chapter 4 is "Analysis strategy". This chapter should describe 0-jet/1-jet 
%and DF/SF categorization, fundamental difference between DF and SF, which category 
%is most sensitive, what is the combination of categories for the most sensitive 
%result (2D DF + cut-based SF  )

%\item
%Title of 10.4 should be "Discovery of new boson". 
%Title of 10.5 should be "Measurement of $\sigma \times BR$". 

%\item 
%addition of VBF : one option is to get the VBF card from Guillelmo, 
%and just run the coupling fit. 

%\item 
%One more chapter on how my result was used for Higgs discovery and property measurement. 
%Tentative title is "Application of my result". This describes Higgs combination 
%where HWW result was used, and emphasize how HWW contributed to the discovery and 
%the understanding of its CP nature. 

%\item 
%Meaing of \mHi=126~\GeV\ Higgs : stabilization of vacuum(look at Joe Lykken's talk at UCSD)

\item 
Terminology : MC or simulation?
