\item 
PU reweighting discussion

\item 
Add object performance : mention which performance is relevant to my analysis. 
Is it important to have a good MET resolution?(In terms of fake MET) 
Is it important to have good a good muon identification? 

\item 
When separating reconstruction and selection, Top-tagging should be should be 
divided properly. 

\item 
Title of chapter 4 is "Analysis strategy". This chapter should describe 0-jet/1-jet 
and DF/SF categorization, fundamental difference between DF and SF, which category 
is most sensitive, what is the combination of categories for the most sensitive 
result (2D DF + cut-based SF  )

\item
Title of 10.4 should be "Discovery of new boson". 
Title of 10.5 should be "Measurement of $\sigma \times BR$". 

\item 
addition of VBF : one option is to get the VBF card from Guillelmo, 
and just run the coupling fit. 

\item 
One more chapter on how my result was used for Higgs discovery and property measurement. 
Tentative title is "Application of my result". This describes Higgs combination 
where HWW result was used, and emphasize how HWW contributed to the discovery and 
the understanding of its CP nature. 

\item 
Meaing of \mHi=126~\GeV\ Higgs : stabilization of vacuum(look at Joe Lykken's talk at UCSD)
