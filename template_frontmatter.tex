%% DEDICATION
%
%  You have three choices here:
%    1. Use the ``dedication'' environment. 
%       Put in the text you want, and everything will be formated for 
%       you. You'll get a perfectly respectable dedication page.
%   
%
%    2. Use the ``mydedication'' environment.  If you don't like the
%       formatting of option 1, use this environment and format things
%       however you wish.
%
%    3. If you don't want a dedication, it's not required.

\begin{abstract}
  In this thesis, we report the result on the measurement of the production rate 
  of the Standard Model(SM) Higgs boson decaying to a pair of W in the full leptonic final state
  using data collected by CMS detector at LHC at 7 and 8~\TeV. The integrated luminosity 
  is \intlumiSevenTeV\ and \intlumiEightTeV\ at 7 and 8~\TeV, respectively. 
  The SM Higgs hypothesis is excluded at \CLs=95~\%\ in $\mHi=128-600~\GeV$.   
  An excess of data is observed around $\mHi=125~\GeV$ which corresponds to significance 
  of $4.0\sigma$ on the background-only hypothesis. The measured production rate normalized 
  to the SM prediction is $0.76 \pm 0.13(stat.) \pm 0.16(syst.)$. 
  A hypothesis test on the spin-parity nature of the new boson shows that data prefers 
  SM Higgs boson to the graviton-like spin-2 model or spin-0 pseudo-scalar model.
