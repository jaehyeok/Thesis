\section{Higgs Mechanism}

%There are four forces in nature, gravity, electromagneticism, weak force 
%and strong force. Gravity is described by general relativity. 
Properties of elementary particles in nature and their interactions (forces)
to each other are described by Standard Model (SM) in particle physics. It is 
based on gauge symmetry and the group sturucture, 
$SU(3)_c \times SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, where  $SU(3)_c$, $SU(2)_L$, and $U(1)_Y$  
describe color, weak isospin, and hyper charge, respectively. 
The gauge symmetry requires the weak gauge bosons to be massless,
but we know that Weak gauge bosons, $W^\pm$ and $Z$ are massive. 
The cure for this is the Higgs mechanism which breaks $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$
to $U(1)_{EM}$, thus giving mass to weak bosons but keeping photons massless.

\subsection{How particles become massive : Higgs Mechanism}
Since EW theory is based on $SU(2)$ symmetry, the Higgs field is 
given as a $SU(2)$ doublet, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi = \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where each element is a complex field, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi^+ = \frac{\phi_1 + i\phi_2}{\sqrt{2}} 
\qquad \textrm{ and } \qquad  
\phi^0 = \frac{\phi_3 + i\phi_4}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{eqnarray} 
We start with the Higgs Lagrangian to understand the essence of SSB 
before making the things more complicated. The full SM Lagrangian will be discussed after that.  
The Higgs Lagrangian is composed of kinetic and potential terms. 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_\phi 
=
\underbrace{
    \left( \partial_\mu \phi \right)^\dagger \left( \partial^\mu \phi \right)
}_\text{kinetic term} 
- 
\underbrace{
    \left( \mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 \right)
}_\text{potential} 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\mu^2<0$ and $\lambda>0$.
The potential $V\left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)$ is invariant under 
$SU(2)$ local gauge transformation, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi(x) 
\rightarrow 
\phi(x)' = e^{i \vec{\alpha}(x) \cdot \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2}} \phi(x)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\vec{\alpha}(x)$ is a vector of parameters and  
$\vec{\sigma}$ is a vector of Pauli matrices. 
$V\left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)$ has the minimum at 
$\displaystyle  \phi^\dagger \phi = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda} = \frac{v^2}{2}$ where 
$v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field $\phi$.
Due to the SU(2) symmetry the choice of vacuum state is not definite 
as seen in the following equation, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi^\dagger \phi = \frac{1}{2} \left( \phi_1^2 + \phi_2^2 + \phi_3^2 + \phi_4^2\right) 
\end{eqnarray} 
This leads to an appropriate choice of vacuum for the physics of interest. 
We choose the vacuum state, $\phi_0$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
and expand around it by $H(x)$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v + H(x) \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $H(x)$ is the physical Higgs field.  
In order to make the lagrangian invariant under SU(2) transformation,
the derivative $\partial_\mu$ should be replaced by the covariant 
derivative $\mathcal{D}_\mu$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{D}_\mu 
= 
\partial_\mu - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B_\mu - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \vec{W}_\mu. 
\end{eqnarray} 
$B_\mu$ and $\vec{W}_\mu$ are the vector field(s) needed for U(1) and 
SU(2) gauge invariance, respectively. 
$g_1$ and $g_2$ are the couplings that decide the strength of 
interactions associated with $B_\mu$ and $\vec{W}_\mu$. 
$Y$(weak hypercharge) and $\frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2}$ are the generators for U(1) and SU(2), respectively. 
Putting this into the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L_\phi}$, the kinetic term becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\left( \mathcal{D}_\mu \phi \right)^\dagger \left( \mathcal{D}^\mu \phi \right) 
&=& ... +  
\phi^\dagger 
\left[ - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B^\mu
       - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \vec{W}^\mu \right]^\dagger 
\left[ - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B^\mu
       - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \vec{W}^\mu \right] 
\phi  
\end{eqnarray}
In order to derive masses of W and Z boson, we use the vacuum state of Higgs field $\phi_0$
because mass are present even without dynamical field.  
With $Y=1$ and $\displaystyle \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right)$, 
writing the explicitly in $2\times2$ matrices, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:WZmass}
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{ \displaystyle \vspace{0.3cm}   
\frac{1}{8} \left| \left(  \begin{array}{cc} 
g_1 B_\mu + g_2 W_\mu^3     & g_2 (W_\mu^1 - iW_\mu^2) \\
g_2 (W_\mu^1 + iW_\mu^2)    & g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \end{array} \right) 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right) \right|^2 
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\hspace{2cm} \vspace{0.3cm} \displaystyle   
= \frac{v^2}{8} \left| \left(  \begin{array}{c} 
g_2 (W_\mu^1 - iW_\mu^2) \\
g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 
\end{array} \right) \right|^2} \\  
& \multicolumn{2}{l}{\hspace{2cm}  \displaystyle   
=   
\frac{v^2 g_2^2}{8} \left[ \left( W_\mu^1 \right)^2  + \left( W_\mu^2 \right)^2 \right] 
+ \frac{v^2}{8} \left( g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)^2
} \end{array}    
\end{eqnarray} 
The first term can be written converting $W^1$ and $W^2$ into 
charge states $\displaystyle W^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( W^1 \mp iW^2 \right)$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{v g_2}{2} \right)^2 
\left[ \left( W_\mu^+ \right)^2  + \left( W_\mu^- \right)^2 \right]. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Thus, we have the mass of charged W boson $\displaystyle M_W = \frac{v g_2}{2}$.
Now we know that the second term in \ref{eq:WZmass} should correspond 
Z boson because that is the only remaining mass boson. Because the 
mixed fields should have the same normalization, the physical field for 
Z boson $Z_\mu$ is 
\begin{eqnarray} 
Z_\mu = \frac{\left( g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives its mass $\displaystyle M_Z = \frac{v}{2} \sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}$. 
We have an orthogonal field that is massless 
(thus mass term does not appear in the Lagrangian), 
\begin{eqnarray} 
A_\mu = \frac{\left( g_1 B_\mu + g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
\end{eqnarray}
This is the field that remains unbroken by SSB. So, it corresponds to photon. 
%Using the definition of weak mixing angle, $\theta_W$, 
%\begin{equation} 
%\sin \theta_W = \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}, \textrm{ and } 
%\cos \theta_W = \frac{g_2}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
%\end{equation} 
Rewriting the Lagrangian using the physical weak boson states $W_\mu^\pm$ and $Z_\mu$,
and their masses, we have the following terms for interactions between Higgs and weak bosons,
\begin{eqnarray} 
2\frac{M_W^2}{v} H\left(x\right) \left( W^+_\mu \right)^2
+ \frac{M_Z^2}{v} H\left(x\right) \left( Z_\mu \right)^2
+ \frac{M_W^2}{v^2} H\left(x\right)^2 \left( W^+_\mu \right)^2
+\frac{M_Z^2}{2v^2} H\left(x\right)^2 \left( Z_\mu \right)^2.
\end{eqnarray} 
For Higgs-Weak boson interactions, the couplings are proportional to the square 
of weak boson mass.

\end{figure}
The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fd_HVterm}. 
Considering additional factorials due to identical particles, the 
vertex factors can be written as $\displaystyle 2i \frac {M_V^2}{v}$ 
and $\displaystyle 2i \frac{M_V^2}{v^2}$ for HVV and HHVV, respectively, 
where V denotes W or Z. 
After SSB, the Higss potential term,  
$\mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 $,
in the Lagrangian becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{Higgs Potential}}
&=&   
\mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 \\ 
&=&   
\frac{\mu^2}{2} ( v + H )^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} ( v + H )^4 \\ 
%&=&   
%\frac{\mu^2}{2} ( v^2 + H^2 + 2vH ) 
%+ \frac{\lambda}{4} ( v^4 + H^4 + 4v^2H^2 + 2v^2H^2 + 4vH^3 + 4v^3H) \\ 
&=& 
... - \mu^2 H^2 - \frac{\mu^2}{v} H^3  - \frac{\mu^2}{4v^2} H^4 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $H^0$ and $H^1$ terms are ignored in the last line. 
\textcolor{red}{I remember that the first order term does not 
affect the lagrangian, but do not remember the argument.}
From the above eq., the Higgs mass is identified as $\mHi^2 =  -2\mu^2$. %= 2\lambda v^2$.
Rewriting the eq, using this definition, we have  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{Higgs Potential}}
&=& 
... - \frac{1}{2} \mHi^2 H^2 - \frac{\mHi^2}{2v} H^3  - \frac{\mHi^2}{8v^2} H^4    
\end{eqnarray}

\label{fig:fd_Hselfterm}
\end{figure}

The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fd_Hselfterm}. 
Now we see that the entire Higgs sector depends on \mHi and $v$.
The $v$ is calculated by $v = \left( \sqrt{2} \gf \right)^{-1/2} = 246~\GeV$  
where $\gf$ is the Fermi contant which is extracted from measurement 
of muon lifetime. 
% \gf meausurement : http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900201012839
Thus, the SM Higgs sector is fully described by \mHi. 
\mHi is a fuction of $\lambda$ and $v$,  $\mHi^2 = 2 \lambda v^2$
and we we do not know the physical meaning of $\lambda$, 
the mass of Higgs boson is not predictable by theory.
It's experimentalist's task to measure \mHi{} and 
complete the Standard Model of particle physics.

The introduced Higgs field had 4 degrees of freedom, $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ 
and $\phi_,4$. But, we chose the Higgs field to have only one degree of freedom, $H(x)$.  
Where did the three go? 
By breaking $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ to $U(1)_{EM}$, the three gauge 
bosons acquired masses. This was done by adding longitudinal components 
to the three bosons. Thus, now we have one physical Higgs field and 
three massive and one massless gauge bosons instead of four unphysical 
Higgs fields and four massless gauge bosons.

The fermions acquire mass by interaction with Higgs field. 
Let's start with leptons whose case is simpler than quarks due to 
absence of right-handed neutrinos, \textit{i.e.} neutrinos are massless.
Below, e means leptons 
We can add SU(2)-invariant terms to the Lagrangian.

      & $T_3$ & Y \\

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:su2Qnum}
\caption{$SU(2) \times U(1)$ quantum numbers}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:su2Qnum} shows the quantum numbers for $SU(2) \times U(1)$. 
From the table, one can see that the interaction such as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
e_R + \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) 
\rightarrow 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
conserves quantum numbers. Given the structure of the interaction, 
we specify the strength with $g_e$. Including the hermitian conjugate 
to the Lagrangian, the lepton-Higgs interaction term becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, lepton} 
&=& 
-g_e \left[ 
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{\nu}_L & \bar{e}_L \end{array} \right)
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) e_R
+ 
\bar{e}_R
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{\phi}_+  & \bar{\phi}_0 \end{array} \right) 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{array} \right)
\right].
\end{eqnarray} 
Using the Higgs field used in SSB 
$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v + H(x) \end{array} \right)$, 
the Lagrangian is calculated to be 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, lepton} 
&=& 
-\frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L \right)  
-\frac{g_e H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L \right)  
\end{eqnarray} 
Since $\bar{e}e = \bar{e}(P_L^2+P_R^2)e = \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L$ where
$P_L$ and $P_R$ are projection operators, the first term 
$\displaystyle -\frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{e}e$ corresponds to the mass term for lepton. 
Thus, the mass is identified to be 
\begin{eqnarray} 
m_e = \frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{eqnarray} 
Rewriting the Lagrangian in terms of $m_e$ instead of an arbitary $g_e$, we get 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int} 
&=& 
- m_e \bar{e}e  -\frac{m_e}{v} \bar{e}e H. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Since there isn't a physical motivation for $g_e$, $m_e$ is not calculable 
by theory, but needs to be experimentally determined. The second term 
corresponds to lepton-Higgs interaction. The size of the interaction 
is proportional to the mass of lepton. Thus, light quarks have very 
weak couplings to Higgs fields. For example, electron has 
$\displaystyle \frac{m_e}{v} = \frac{0.5~\MeV}{246~\GeV} \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-6}\right)$
and muon has $\displaystyle \frac{106~\MeV}{246~\GeV} \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$.

The case for quarks is more complicated due to presence of right-handed up-type 
quarks opposite to lepton case. In order to generate masses for up-type 
quarks, we need a new Higgs doublet 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi_c 
= i \sigma_2 \phi^* 
=  \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_0^* \\ -\phi_- \end{array} \right) 
=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} v + H(x) \\ 0 \end{array} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
The new Higgs field is invariant under $SU(2)$ transformation and has Y = -1. 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, quark} 
&=& 
-g_{d} \left[ 
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{u}_L & \bar{d}_L \end{array} \right)
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) d_R  \right]
-g_{u} \left[ 
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{u}_L & \bar{d}_L \end{array} \right)
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_0^*  \\ -\phi_+ \end{array} \right) u_R  \right] 
+ h.c. \\
%&=& 
%-\frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{d}_L d_R + \bar{d}_R d_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_d H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{d}_L d_R + \bar{d}_R d_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{u}_L u_R + \bar{u}_R u_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_u H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{u}_L u_R + \bar{u}_R u_L \right) \\
&=&  
-\frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{d}d - \frac{g_d H}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{d}d  
-\frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{u}u - \frac{g_u H}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{u}u \\
&=&  
- m_d \bar{d}d  -\frac{m_d}{v} \bar{d}d H
- m_u \bar{u}u  -\frac{m_u}{v} \bar{u}u H
\end{eqnarray} 
where 
\begin{eqnarray} 
m_d = \frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \textrm{ and } \quad   
m_u = \frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{eqnarray} 
is used as the lepton case. The strength of interaction depends on the 
fermion mass, $m_f / v$.

\section{Production and Decay of Higgs Boson}

\subsection{Production of Higgs Boson}
Standard model Higgs boson is generated by 4 major processes, 
gluon-gluon fusion (ggH : $gg \rightarrow H$), 
vector boson fusion (qqH : $q\bar{q}\rightarrow H$),
associated production with vector bosons (VH : $q\bar{q}\rightarrow VH$), and 
associated production with heavy quarks(QQH : $q\bar{q}\rightarrow Q\bar{Q}H$). 
Figure X.X shows the Feynman diagrams corresponding those mechanisms.
Since H does not couple to gluon in ggH process it is produced via a top loop.
At LHC ggH has the largest production rate due to PDF and 
the heaviness of top quark. 
\begin{figure*}[t]

\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/Higgs_XS_8TeV_LM200.eps}

as a function of \mHi{} at $\sqrt{s}=8~\TeV$ for each 
production mode. %\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}. 
The ggF and VBF processes are 
calculated in complex-pole-scheme (CPS), while other WH/ZH and ttH processes 
are calculated in zero-width-approximation (ZWA). }
\label{fig:Higgs_XS_8TeV_LM200}
\end{figure*}

At hadron collider the hadronic cross section($\sigma$) is calculated with 
parton-level cross-section ($\hat{\sigma}$) convoluted with PDF, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma (pp \rightarrow H+X) 
= 
\sum_{i,j} \int dx_1 dx_2 f_i(x_1) f_j(x_2) 
\hat{\sigma} \left( ij \rightarrow H+X \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where i and j are colliding partons, 
$x_1$ and $x_2$ are longitudinal momentum fractions carried by i and j. 
Each component in the equation is subject to the following uncertainties.
The partonic cross section is calculated at given
a renormalizaion scale $\mu_R$ and a factorization scale $\mu_F$. 
Due to possible uncalculated higher-order QCD radiative corrections,
the uncertainty is estimated by varying the scales around 
the central values. In the de Florian and Grazzini (dFG) 
calculation [ref], the central values are chosen to be $\mu_0 = \mHi$. 
The scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ are varied are in the range 
$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\mu_0 < \mu_F, \mu_R < 2\mu_0$ 
with a constraint $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} < \frac{\mu_F}{\mu_R} < 2$. 
PDF is obtained by fitting on data measured in deep-inelastic scattering, 
Drell-Yan, and jet production from a wide variety of different experiments. 
The accuracy on those data can introduce uncertainty on PDF calculation. 
In addition, strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ is used in DGLAP evolution [ref] 
to the higher $Q^2$ region. Thus, its uncertainty also contributes to 
the total cross section. There are other uncertainties due to 
the EW corrections, the different choice of top and bottom quark masses, 
and the use of large-$m_T$ method. But, the effect to the 
hadronic cross section is less than a few percent \cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}
for ggF.

Figure \ref{fig:Higgs_XS_8TeV_LM200} shows the hadronic cross sections 
as a function of \mHi{} for SM Higgs production and uncertainty 
in different production modes. The ggF and VBF cross sections 
are based on complex-pole-scheme (CPS), while VH and ttH ones 
are based on zero-width-approximation (ZWA).

\caption{The order of QCD and EW calculations.}
\end{table}
The order of QCD and EW calculations are summarized in Table 
\ref{tab:Higgs_XS_8TeV_order}. The uncertainty is linear combination 
of uncertainties from QCD scale varitaion and PDF+$\alpha_S$.
At $\mHi=125~\GeV$ ggH contributes $\sim 87 \%$ to the total cross section.


%The PDF and parton-level cross section depend on the 
%renormalizaion scale $\mu_R$ because they contain ultraviolet divergences 
%to be subtacted through a renormalization procedure. [ref] 
%In addition PDF is calculated with a factorization scale $\mu_F$.

\subsection{Decay of Higgs Boson}
The interaction term in the Lagrangian shows that the Higgs can 
couple to a pair of weak bosons($VV$). Thus, Higgs decays into $W^+W^-$ and $ZZ$.
Depending on the mass of Higgs, one or two of the bosons can be off-shell. 
Thus we consider three cases where both of them are on-shell$(VV)$, 
one is on-shell and the other is off-shell$(VV^*)$, 
and both of them are off-shell$(V^*V^*)$. 
\begin{itemize} 
%
\item  Both bosons are on-shell($ H \rightarrow VV$) [ref] : 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\Gamma \left( H \rightarrow VV \right) 
= 
\frac{\gf \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \delta_V \sqrt{1-4\epsilon^2} 
\left( 1 - 4\epsilon^2 - 12\epsilon^4 \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\displaystyle \epsilon = \frac{M_V}{\mHi}$ and $\delta_W=2$ and $\delta_Z=1$.
The ratio of londitudinal polarization is given by \cite{PhysRevD.49.79}
\begin{eqnarray} 
R_L 
= 
\frac{\Gamma_L}{\Gamma_T + \Gamma_L}    
= 
\frac{1 - 4\epsilon^2 - 4\epsilon^4}{1 - 4\epsilon^2 - 12\epsilon^4} 
\xrightarrow{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{} 1
\end{eqnarray} 
Thus, vector bosons are longitudinally polarized at high \mHi{} ($\epsilon \rightarrow 0$). 
At the production threshold, $\displaystyle \mHi = 2M_V \rightarrow \epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$, 
$R_L$ is 2 which means that longitudinal and transverse polarizations are equally populated. 
In addition, the decay width to WW is reduced to 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\Gamma \left( H \rightarrow WW \right)
&\rightarrow&
\frac{\gf \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \times 2 \\
&=&  
2 \frac{ 1.16637 \times 10^{-5}~\GeV^{-2} \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \\
&\approx&
0.33 \mHi \times \frac{\mHi^2}{\TeV^2} (\TeV).   
\end{eqnarray} 
For example, at $\mHi=1~\TeV$, decay width for WW is 0.33 \TeV.
Practically t is hard to claim a Higgs resonance at high mass regions.

\section{Limits on Higgs Boson Mass} 

\subsection{Theoretical Limits} 

\subsubsection{Perturbative Unitarity : $W_L^+W_L^- \rightarrow W_L^+W_L^-$}
The cross section of longditudinal vector boson scattering, $V_LV_L \to V_LV_L$, 
increases as the energy increases, which eventually violate unitarity. 
This will be discussed in thie subsection taking  $W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^-$
as an example.

\caption{Feynman diagrams for $W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^-$ scattering.} 
\label{fig:FD_unitary}
\end{figure*}
Fig. \ref{fig:FD_unitary} shows Feynman diagrams for this process.
In the high energy limit $s \gg \mW^2$, the scattering amplitude is \cite{Djouadi20081} 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:WWscat}
\mathcal{A}\left( W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^- \right) 
\sim 
- \frac{1}{v^2}  \left( -s - t + \frac{s^2}{s - \mHi^2} + \frac{t^2}{t - \mHi^2} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
\textcolor{red}{What does the point diagram correspond to in this equation?}  
According to the Electroweak Equivalence Theorem \cite{31-33} which says 
that at very high energy the longitudinal vector bosons can be replaced by 
their associated Goldstone bosons. Thus, the scattering amplitude can be written 
using Goldstone bosons ($w^\pm$)
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{A}\left( w^+w^- \to w^+w^- \right) 
= 
- \frac{\mHi^2}{v^2}  \left( 2 + \frac{\mHi^2}{s - \mHi^2} + \frac{\mHi^2}{t - \mHi^2} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
An scattering amplitude can be decomposed into partial waves $a_l$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{A} = 16 \pi \sum_{i=0}^\infty 
              \left( 2l+1 \right) P_l \left( \cos \theta \right) a_l
\end{eqnarray} 
where $P_l$ is the Legendre polynominals and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.
For $2 \to 2$ cross section using Optical theorem \cite{optical}, we have the 
following identity on cross section ($\sigma$) 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma 
= \frac{16 \pi}{s} \sum_{i=0}^\infty  \left( 2l+1 \right) \left| a_l \right|^2 
= \frac{1}{s} Im \left[ \mathcal{A} \left(\theta = 0 \right)  \right]
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives the unitary condition, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\left| a_l \right|^2 = Im \left( a_l \right) 
\quad &\Rightarrow& \quad  
Re\left( a_l \right)^2 
+ \left[ Im\left( a_l \right)  - \frac{1}{2} \right]^2 
= \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \\
\label{eq:unitaryWW}
\quad &\Rightarrow& \quad 
\left| Re \left( a_l \right) \right| < \frac{1}{2}.   
\end{eqnarray} 
Then, the $l=0$ amplitude in the limit of $ s \gg \mHi^2$ becomes  
\begin{eqnarray} 
a_0\left( w^+w^- \to w^+w^- \right)  
&=&  
- \frac{\mHi^2}{16\pi v^2}  
\left[ 2 + \frac{\mHi^2}{s - \mHi^2} 
       - \frac{\mHi^2}{s} \log \left( 1 + \frac{s}{\mHi^2} \right) \right]  \\
&\rightarrow&
- \frac{\mHi^2}{8\pi v^2} 
\end{eqnarray} 
The unitary condition (Eq. (\ref{eq:unitaryWW})) gives upper bound on \mHi, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\left| Re \left( a_0 \right) \right| 
&=&  \frac{\mHi^2}{8\pi v^2} < \frac{1}{2} \\ 
&\Rightarrow& 
\mHi < 2 \sqrt{\pi} v \simeq 870~\GeV. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Including other scattering channels, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
Z_LZ_L, \,\,\, HH, \,\,\, Z_LH, \,\,\, W_L^+H, \,\,\, W^+_LZ_L 
\end{eqnarray} 
the constraint on \mHi{} becomes tigher \cite{Djouadi20081}, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:unitaryAll}
\mHi < 710~\GeV.
\end{eqnarray}
This means that in SM unitariry will be violated if $\mHi>710~\GeV$
unless there is a new physics that recovers it. 
So far we calculated only tree-level terms, so we can expect that adding 
higher order terms can solve this problem. But, including higher order 
terms does not gaurantee that the unitary will be restored because 
in the high \mHi{} regime coupling to Higgs is too large and perturbative 
calculation breaks down. Thus, the mass bound given in eq.~\ref{eq:unitaryAll}  
can be considered the \mHi~regime where perturbative calculation is reliable 
in all $s$.

\subsubsection{Triviality and Stability bounds}
% Triviality

\caption{Feynman diagrams for Higgs boson quartic interaction. Left is tree lebel and 
the right three are one-loop correction by Higgs boson itself.} 
\label{fig:FD_triviality} 
\end{figure*} 
The variation of the Higgs quartic couping $\lambda$ is described by Renormalization Group Equation (RGE). 
When we consider one-loop radiation correction by Higgs boson itself to $\lambda$ which are shon in the 
Fig.\ref{fig:FD_triviality}, the corresponding RGE is given by \cite{Djouadi20081} 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\frac{d}{dQ^2} \lambda (Q^2) 
= 
\frac{3}{4\pi^2} \lambda^2(Q^2) + \textrm{higher orders} 
\end{eqnarray} 
The solution to this equation is given by 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\displaystyle  \lambda(Q^2) = \frac{\lambda(v^2)} {\left[\displaystyle   1 - \frac{3}{4\pi^2} \lambda(v^2) \log{\frac{Q^2}{v^2}}\right] } 
\end{eqnarray} 
where the EWSB scale is used as a reference energy point, $Q_0 = v$. 
If the energy is much smaller than the EWSB scale, $Q^2\ll v^2$, 
the quadratic coupling goes to 0, and the theory is called 
``trivial", which means that there is no interaction. 
On the otherhand, if the energy is much larger than the EWSB scale, $Q^2\gg v^2$,
as Q increases the coupling will be infinite at a certain energy scale, $\Lambda_{cut}$. 
Using $\lambda = \mHi^2/2v^2$ and the defition of $\lambda$ that it is positive, 
we have the following equation for denominator,
\begin{eqnarray} 
1 > \frac{3}{4\pi^2} \frac{\mHi^2}{2v^2} \log{\frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2}} 
\qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad 
\mHi^2 > \frac{8\pi^2v^2}{\log{\displaystyle  \frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2}}},
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives a scale-dependent bound on \mHi. Imposing $\Lambda_{cut} = \mHi$ 
in which case the theory is not reliable, i.e. valid scale of theory is same 
as the mass of a particle, the bound on the Higgs mass is $\mHi < 640~\GeV$. 
This result is consistent with the limit from unitarity constraint. 

% Stability 
In the previous discussion, only was one-loop correction by Higgs itself considered.
This is a proper approximation when $\lambda$ is large. But, in other cases
where $\lambda$ is small, we need to consider the contributions from fermions 
and vector bosons. Since, the strength of interaction with Higgs boson is proportional 
to the particle mass, we consider only heavy particles, vector bosons and top quarks.   
In the limit of small Higgs quartic couplings, $\lambda \ll \lambda_t, g_1, g_2$ 
where $\lambda_t$ is the top Yukawa coupling given by $\sqrt{2} \mt / v$, the RGE is 
given by \cite{Djouadi20081}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:stability_ddlogQ2}
\frac{d}{dQ^2} \lambda (Q^2)  
\simeq
\frac{1}{16\pi^2}  
\left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right)   \right].
\end{eqnarray} 
Taking EWSB scale as the reference point, the solution to Eq.~(\ref{eq:stability_ddlogQ2}) is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\lambda\left(Q^2\right) 
= 
\lambda\left(v^2\right)  
+ 
\frac{1}{16\pi^2}  \left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} 
                          + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right) \right]
                    \log \frac{Q^2}{v^2}.
\end{eqnarray} 
As $\lambda(v^2)$ becomes small, the couping can go negative, leading the vacuum unstable.   
Thus, in order to maintain the stability of vacuum, $\lambda\left(Q^2\right)$ should be 
positive. This requirement gives
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mHi^2 
&>&
\frac{v^2}{8\pi^2}  \left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} 
                          + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right) \right]
                    \log \frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2} \\
&=&  
\frac{v^2}{8\pi^2}  \left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} 
                          + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right) \right]
                    \log \frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2} \\
&=&

\caption{ Upper and lower bound of \mHi as a function of $\Lambda_{cut}$.
}
\label{fig:trivial_vacstab}
\end{figure*}

So far the higher order contributions were taken up to 1-loop corrections. 
There are calculations upto 2-loops and Fig. \ref{fig:trivial_vacstab} 
shows lower bound (vacuum stability) and upper bound (triviality) of \mHi 
as a function of new cutoff scale, $\Lambda_{cut}$.

%
\subsubsection{Fine tuning}
The 1-loop radiative corrections to Higgs mass when only are W/Z/H and top contributions 
condsidered is given by \cite{Djouadi20081}
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mHi^2 
= 
\left( \mHi^0 \right)^2 + \frac{3 \Lambda_{UV}^2}{8\pi^2v^2} 
\left[ \mHi^2 + 2\mW^2 + \mZ^2- 4 \mt^2 \right] 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\mHi^0$ is the fundamental parameter of SM and $\Lambda_{UV}$ is the 
UV cutoff scale. Therefore, unless $\Lambda_{UV}$ is in the same scale of 
EWSB($100~\GeV - 1~\TeV$), there should be an incredible fine-tuning between 
$\mHi^0$ and the radiative correction to get \mHi{} in EWSB scale.  
For a quantitative discussion, we first need to define what fine-tuning means. 
Fine-tuning is defined as the sensitivity of the weak scale to
the cutoff, $\left| \delta \mW^2(\Lambda_{UV}) / \mW^2 \right|$, where $\delta \mW^2$ is the 
difference between the tree and loop values, with all other quantities held fixed \cite{Kolda:2000wi}.
So, the metric, $\mathcal{F}$, is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{F}
= \left| \frac{\delta \mW^2}{\mW^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta v^2)}{v^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta \mu^2}{\mu^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta \mHi^2}{\mHi^2} \right|
= \frac{2\Lambda^2}{\mHi^2} \left| \sum_{n} 
  \log^2\left( \frac{\Lambda_{UV}}{\mHi} \right) \right| 
\end{eqnarray} 
and $\mathcal{F} \le 1$ represents that there is no fine-tuning. 
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/finetuning.pdf}
\caption{Constraint contour from fine tuning, vacuum stability, and triviality}.
\label{fig:finetuning}
\end{figure*}
The fig.~\ref{fig:finetuning} \cite{Kolda:2000wi} shows two regions in $[\Lambda,\mHi]$ plane
where $\Lambda$ is the UV cutoff scale, $\Lambda_{UV}$; 
$\mathcal{F}>10$ in light-hatching labeled as $10~\%$ 
and $\mathcal{F}>100$ in thick-hatching labeled as $1~\%$.  
In case of light Higgs scenario, the fine-tuning is even at the low energy scale. 
For example, at \mHi=130 \GeV{} the fineo-tuning of $\mathcal{F}>10(10~\%)$ requires 
$\Lambda<2.3~\TeV$. This means that new physics should exist in the regime where 
LHC experiements can probe.

\subsection{Experimental Limits}

\subsubsection{Indirect search} 

There are EWK measurements that are dependent on \mHi. 
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/FD_Wmass_Hloop.pdf}
\caption{Feynman diagram for 1 loop correctioin by Higgs boson to the W propagator.}.
\label{fig:FD_Wmass_Hloop}
\end{figure*}
For example, the mass of W boson has one-loop correction of Higgs boson 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FD_Wmass_Hloop}. Its contribution to the W mass 
is parametrized by $\Delta r$ in the following equation 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mW^2 
= 
\frac{\pi\alpha}{\sqrt{2} \gf} 
\frac{1}{\left( 1 - \frac{\mW^2}{\mZ^2} \right)} 
\left( 1 + \Delta r \right),
\end{eqnarray} 
and the correction is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta r \simeq 
\frac{\gf \mW^2}{8 \sqrt{2} \pi^2} \frac{11}{3} 
\left( \log \frac{\mHi^2}{\mW^2} - \frac{5}{6} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
which is depedent on \mHi{} logarithmically. Thus, by measuring other quantities 
in the equation, we can constrain \mHi{} up to the uncertainties to the measured 
quantities. Going one step further, we can use more variables, not only \mW, 
and put them into a statisitcal fit \cite{LEP-2}. A simultaneous fit is done to
$\Delta \alpha_{had}^{(5)}(\mZ^2)$, $\alpha_S(\mZ^2)$,  
\mZ, \mt, and  $\log_{10} \left( \mHi \right)$
on the data collected by LEP-I/II, SLD, and Tevatron \cite{LEP-2}.

%top plots shows the constraints on \mHi %from each variable used by global fit, 
shows $\Delta \chi^2$ curve from EWK precision measurements
assuming that Standard Model is the true theory of nature \cite{LEP-2}. 
The prefered \mHi{} is $94_{-24}^{+29}~\GeV$. It also shows that 
the upper limit on \mHi at C.L. = 95 \% is 152 \GeV. 

%
\subsubsection{Direct search}  

Before 2012, there were direct searches for SM Higgs boson by LEP, Tevatron, 
and LHC experiments. 
The LEP data showed upper limit of $\mHi<114.4~\GeV$ at \CLs = 95 \% \cite{Beringer:1900zz} 
and the Tevatron showed exclusion of SM Higgs hypothesis in the range of 
$147~\GeV < \mHi < 179~\GeV$ at \CLs = 95 \% \cite{Beringer:1900zz}. 
At the end of 2011, the LHC experiments(CMS and ATLAS) showes their 7 TeV results
on the standard model Higgs search \cite{Chatrchyan201226,Aad201249}.

\label{fig:2011HiggsExp}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:2011HiggsExp} shows the 95\% C.L. upper limits on $\sigma/\sigma_{\textrm{SM}}$
as a function of \mHi{} in the range of 110 - 145 \GeV{} for CMS on the left and 
110 - 150 \GeV for ATLAS on the right. In both experiments, search was performed up to 
\mHi = 600 \GeV, but only low \mHi{} region is shown on the plots. 
In CMS, the observed exclusion range is 118 - 543 \GeV{} 
with expected exclusion range is 127 - 600 \GeV.     
In ATLAS, the observed exclusion range is 112.9 - 115.5, 131-238, and 251-466 \GeV{} 
with expected exclusion range 124 - 519 \GeV.  
Both experiments, CMS and ATLAS, show local excess of 
$3.1\sigma$ and $3.5\sigma$, repectively, around \mHi = 125 \GeV{}

\subsection{Angular distribution of leptons in the final state}

The spin of SM Higgs is zero, so by helicity conservation the total spin 
of the WW system should be zero. 
\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:HiggsSpin}
\end{figure}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HiggsSpin}, if we take 
the direction of $W^+$ momentum as z axis in the CM of Higgs,
there are two cases where the spin direction is parellel to the 
momentum direction (transverse polarization) and one case where 
it is perpendicular to the momentum direction(longitudinal polarization). 
In case of transverse polarization, the leptons from Ws have strong 
angular dependence due to V-A nature of weak decays, i.e. neutrinos 
are always left-handed(anti-neutrinos are always right-handed). 
Let's take the case of $W^+$ spin in the z direction as an example.
In order for the neutrino from $W^+$ to be left-handed, the direction 
of the neutrino should be in the - z direction, thus lepton should 
fly to z direction. In order for the anti-neutrino from $W^-$ to be 
right-handed, the direction of the anti-neutrino should be in the 
- z direction, thus lepton should fly to z direction.
Therefore, both leptons tend so move in the same direction 
resulting the angle between the two leptons to be small. 
This is somewhat diluted due to boost of Higgs and Ws, 
but the effect is still visible and used to separate signals 
from non-resonant WW background. 
On the other hand, in case of longitudinal polarization, 
no specific angular correlation is present.

\subsection{Kinematic variables}
\label{subsec:kinimetic_variables}

\begin{figure}[htp]

\label{fig:genhww}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:genhww} shows distributions of kinematic variables for 
multiple Higgs hypotheses, $\mHi = 110, 125, 145, 160,\textrm{, and } 200~\GeV$. 
The plotted variables are leading and trailing lepton \pt, 
azimuthal angle difference between the two leptons $\delphill$, 
di-lepton invariant mass $\mll$, and Higgs transverse mass $\mT$ which is 
defined as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mT = \sqrt{2\ptll\met(1-cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell-\met}))}
\end{eqnarray} 
where \pt{} is transverse momentum of the dilepton system, 
\met{} is missing transverse momentum, and  
$\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell-\met}$ is the angle between dilepton
direction and \met{} in the transverse plane.
The most of events have leading lepton \ptlmax{} greater than 20~\GeV{} 
for all \mHi{} hypotheses. The The trailing lepton \ptlmin{} is 
quite populated at low \ptlmin{} region, especially for low \mHi{} 
hypotheses. In case of \mHi = 125~\GeV, approximately 25 \% of 
events are rejected by requiring $\ptlmin>10~\GeV$. 
The \delphill, azimuthal angle differece between the two leptons,  
shows non-straightforward trend. The angle tends to get smaller 
as \mHi{} increases up to 160 \GeV, and the angle becomes wide 
after \mHi = 160 \GeV. This behavior was expected in the 
fig.~\ref{fig:HVV_polarization_ratio} where the fraction of the 
longitudinal polarization is at the minimum at \mHi = 2\mW{} which is about 160 \GeV. 
Since small \delphill{} yields small \mll{}, we expect small \mll{} 
for low \mHi hypotheses. The Higgs transverse mass \mT{} shows clear 
drop at \mHi\textcolor{red}{why tail and lazy drop at 200 GeV?},

\subsection{CMS HWW results as of 2011}

Before 2012, 4.6 \ifb{} of data at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ collected by CMS detector 
was analyzed for SM Higgs search \cite{Chatrchyan201291}.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:hww2011} shows exclusion limit using the state-of-the-art 
analysis technique at the time of study. 
The observed exclusion limit at \CLs  = 95 \% is \mHi = 129 - 270 \GeV 
with expected limit \mHi = 127 - 270 \GeV.
