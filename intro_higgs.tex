\section{Higgs Mechanism}

%There are four forces in nature, gravity, electromagneticism, weak force 
%and strong force. Gravity is described by general relativity. 
Properties of elementary particles in nature and their interactions(forces)
to each other are described by Standard Model(SM)~\cite{Glashow:1961tr,Weinberg:1967tq,Salam:1963tr} 
in particle physics. It is 
based on the gauge symmetry and the group sturucture of 
$\textrm{SU(3)}_\textrm{c} \otimes \textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L} 
\otimes \textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$, where  $\textrm{SU(3)}_\textrm{c}$, 
$\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L}$ and $\textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$  
describe color, weak isospin and hyper charge, respectively. 
The gauge symmetry requires the weak gauge bosons to be massless,
but experimentally we know that Weak gauge bosons, $W^\pm$ and $Z$ are massive. 
The cure for this is the Higgs 
mechanism~\cite{Englert:1964et,Higgs:1964ia,Higgs:1964pj,Guralnik:1964eu,Higgs:1966ev, Kibble:1967sv}
based on the spontanesous symmetry breaking(SSB)
which breaks $\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L} \otimes \textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$
to $\textrm{U(1)}_{\textrm{EM}}$. It gives masses to weak bosons but keeps photon massless.

\subsection{How particles become massive : Higgs Mechanism}
Since Electroweak(EWK) theory is based on SU(2) symmetry, the Higgs field is 
given as a SU(2) doublet, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi = \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where each element is a complex field, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi^+ = \frac{\phi_1 + i\phi_2}{\sqrt{2}} 
\qquad \textrm{ and } \qquad  
\phi^0 = \frac{\phi_3 + i\phi_4}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{eqnarray} 
We start with the Higgs Lagrangian to understand the essence of 
spontanesous symmetry breaking(SSB) before making things more 
complicated. The full SM Lagrangian will be discussed later.  
The Higgs Lagrangian($\mathcal{L}_\phi$) is composed of the kinetic 
and the potential terms. 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:lagHiggs}
\mathcal{L}_\phi 
=
\underbrace{
    \left( \partial_\mu \phi \right)^\dagger \left( \partial^\mu \phi \right)
}_\text{kinetic term} 
- 
\underbrace{
    \left( \mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 \right)
}_\text{potential} 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\mu^2<0$ and $\lambda>0$.
The potential term which is a function of $ \phi^\dagger \phi$ is invariant under 
SU(2) local gauge transformation, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi(x) 
\rightarrow 
\phi(x)' = e^{i \vec{\alpha}(x) \cdot \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2}} \phi(x),
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\vec{\alpha}(x)$ is a vector of parameters and  
$\vec{\sigma}$ is a vector of Pauli matrice,  
\begin{align*}
\sigma_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1\\
                            1 & 0
            \end{pmatrix}, 
\quad 
\sigma_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i\\
                            i & 0
            \end{pmatrix}
\quad 
\textrm{and} 
\quad 
\sigma_3 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0\\
                            0 & -1
            \end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
The potential has the minimum at 
%$\displaystyle  \phi^\dagger \phi = -\frac{\mu^2}{2\lambda} = \frac{v^2}{2}$ where 
$ \phi^\dagger \phi = -\mu^2/2\lambda = v^2/2$ where 
$v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field $\phi$.
Due to SU(2) symmetry, the choice of vacuum state is not definite 
as seen in the following equation, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi^\dagger \phi 
= 
\frac{1}{2} \left( \phi_1^2 + \phi_2^2 + \phi_3^2 + \phi_4^2\right) 
=
\frac{v^2}{2} 
\end{eqnarray}
where there are 4 real variables with only one contraint. 
This leads to an appropriate choice of vacuum for the physics of interest. 
We choose the vacuum state, $\phi_0$, as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
and expand around it by $H(x)$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:HiggsfieldSSB}
\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v + H(x) \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $H(x)$ is the physical Higgs field.  
In order to make the lagrangian invariant under SU(2) transformation,
the derivative $\partial_\mu$ should be replaced by the covariant 
derivative $\mathcal{D}_\mu$,
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{D}_\mu 
= 
\partial_\mu - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B_\mu - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \overrightarrow{W}_\mu. 
\end{eqnarray} 
$B_\mu$ and $\overrightarrow{W}_\mu$ are the vector fields needed for U(1) and 
SU(2) gauge invariance, respectively. 
The $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the couplings that decide the strength of the
interactions associated with $B_\mu$ and $\overrightarrow{W}_\mu$. 
$Y$(weak hypercharge) and $\vec{\sigma}/2$ are the generators for U(1) and SU(2), respectively. 
Putting this into the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L_\phi}$, the kinetic term contains 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:kintermHiggsLag}
%\left( \mathcal{D}_\mu \phi \right)^\dagger \left( \mathcal{D}^\mu \phi \right) 
%= ... + 
\phi^\dagger 
\left[ - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B^\mu
       - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \overrightarrow{W}^\mu \right]^\dagger 
\left[ - ig_1 \frac{Y}{2} B^\mu
       - ig_2 \frac{\vec{\sigma}}{2} \cdot \overrightarrow{W}^\mu \right] 
\phi.  
\end{eqnarray}
In order to derive the masses of W and Z bosons, we use the vacuum state of Higgs field $\phi_0$
because masses are present even without dynamical fields.  
With $Y=1$ and $\displaystyle \phi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right)$, 
and writing explicitly in $2\times2$ matrices, eq.~(\ref{eq:kintermHiggsLag}) becomes 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:WZmass}
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{ \displaystyle \vspace{0.3cm}   
\frac{1}{8} \left| \left(  \begin{array}{cc} 
g_1 B_\mu + g_2 W_\mu^3     & g_2 (W_\mu^1 - iW_\mu^2) \\
g_2 (W_\mu^1 + iW_\mu^2)    & g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \end{array} \right) 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v \end{array} \right) \right|^2 
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{l}{\hspace{2cm} \vspace{0.3cm} \displaystyle   
= \frac{v^2}{8} \left| \left(  \begin{array}{c} 
g_2 (W_\mu^1 - iW_\mu^2) \\
g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 
\end{array} \right) \right|^2} \\  
& \multicolumn{2}{l}{\hspace{2cm}  \displaystyle   
=   
\frac{v^2 g_2^2}{8} \left[ \left( W_\mu^1 \right)^2  + \left( W_\mu^2 \right)^2 \right] 
+ \frac{v^2}{8} \left( g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)^2.
} \end{array}    
\end{eqnarray} 
The first term can be re-written using charge states, 
$\displaystyle W^\pm = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( W^1 \mp iW^2 \right)$, 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{v g_2}{2} \right)^2 
\left[ \left( W_\mu^+ \right)^2  + \left( W_\mu^- \right)^2 \right]. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Thus, we have the mass of charged W boson $\displaystyle M_W = \frac{v g_2}{2}$.
Now we know that the second term in eq.~(\ref{eq:WZmass}) should correspond to 
Z boson because that is the only remaining massive boson. Imposing the same 
normalization to the mixed field as the unmixed fields, the physical field for 
Z boson, $Z_\mu$, is given by
\begin{eqnarray} 
Z_\mu = \frac{\left( g_1 B_\mu - g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives its mass, $\displaystyle M_Z = \frac{v}{2} \sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}$. 

There is a massless field orthogonal to $Z_\mu$,  
\begin{eqnarray} 
A_\mu = \frac{\left( g_1 B_\mu + g_2 W_\mu^3 \right)}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
\end{eqnarray}
It does not appear in the Lagrangian because its mass therm is zero.
This is the field that remains unbroken by SSB. So, it corresponds to photon. 
%Using the definition of weak mixing angle, $\theta_W$, 
%\begin{equation} 
%\sin \theta_W = \frac{g_1}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}, \textrm{ and } 
%\cos \theta_W = \frac{g_2}{\sqrt{g_1^2+g_2^2}}  
%\end{equation} 

Re-writing the potential term in eq.~(\ref{eq:lagHiggs})
using the physical weak boson states, $W_\mu^\pm$ and $Z_\mu$,
and their masses, we have the following terms for interactions between Higgs and weak bosons,
\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{\displaystyle 
2\frac{M_W^2}{v} H(x) W^+_\mu W^-_\mu
+ \frac{M_Z^2}{v} H(x) \left( Z_\mu \right)^2
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hspace{2cm} \displaystyle
+ \frac{M_W^2}{v^2} H(x)^2 W^+_\mu W^-_\mu 
+\frac{M_Z^2}{2v^2} H(x)^2 \left( Z_\mu \right)^2.
} \end{array}   
\end{eqnarray} 
For Higgs-Weak boson interactions, the couplings are proportional to the square 
of weak boson mass.

\end{figure}
The corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:fd_HVterm}. 
Considering additional factorials due to identical particles, the 
vertex factors can be written as $\displaystyle 2i \frac {m_V^2}{v}$ 
and $\displaystyle 2i \frac{m_V^2}{v^2}$ for H-VV and HH-VV vertices, respectively, 
where V denotes W or Z. 

After SSB, the Higss potential term,  
$\mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 $,
in the Lagrangian becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{Higgs Potential}}
&=&   
\mu^2 \phi^\dagger \phi + \lambda \left( \phi^\dagger \phi \right)^2 \\ 
&=&   
\frac{\mu^2}{2} ( v + H )^2 + \frac{\lambda}{4} ( v + H )^4 \\ 
%&=&   
%\frac{\mu^2}{2} ( v^2 + H^2 + 2vH ) 
%+ \frac{\lambda}{4} ( v^4 + H^4 + 4v^2H^2 + 2v^2H^2 + 4vH^3 + 4v^3H) \\ 
&=& 
\label{eq:HiggsPontential}
... - \mu^2 H^2 - \frac{\mu^2}{v} H^3  - \frac{\mu^2}{4v^2} H^4 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $H^0$ and $H^1$ terms are ignored in the last line
because they are irrelevant in S-matrix calculations. 
%\textcolor{red}{I remember that the first order term does not 
%affect the lagrangian, but do not remember the argument.}
From eq.~(\ref{eq:HiggsPontential}), the Higgs mass is identified 
as $\mHi^2 =  -2\mu^2$. %= 2\lambda v^2$.
Using this definition, eq.~(\ref{eq:HiggsPontential}) becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{\textrm{Higgs Potential}}
&=& 
... - \frac{1}{2} \mHi^2 H^2 - \frac{\mHi^2}{2v} H^3  - \frac{\mHi^2}{8v^2} H^4    
\end{eqnarray}

Now we see that the entire Higgs sector depends on only \mHi\ and $v$.
The $v$ is calculated by $v = \left( \sqrt{2} \gf \right)^{-1/2} = 246~\GeV$  
where $\gf$ is the Fermi contant which is extracted from measurement 
of muon lifetime. 
% \gf meausurement : http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900201012839
Thus, the SM Higgs sector is fully described by \mHi. 
\mHi\ is a fuction of $\lambda$ and $v$($\mHi^2 = 2 \lambda v^2$)
and we do not know the physical meaning of $\lambda$, so 
the mass of Higgs boson is not predictable by theory.
It's experimentalists' task to measure \mHi\ and 
complete the Standard Model of particle physics.

The introduced Higgs field had 4 degrees of freedom, $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3$ 
and $\phi_4$ before SSB. But, we chose the Higgs field to have only one degree 
of freedom, $H(x)$.  Where did the three go? 
By breaking $\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L} \otimes \textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$ to $U(1)_{EM}$, 
the three gauge bosons acquired masses. This was done by adding longitudinal components 
to the three gauge bosons. As a result, we have only one physical Higgs field and 
three massive and one massless gauge bosons, instead of four unphysical 
Higgs fields and four massless gauge bosons.

The fermions acquire their masses by interacting with Higgs field. 
Let's start a discusstion with leptons because the absence of right-handed neutrinos, 
\textit{i.e.} neutrinos are massless, makes the case simpler than quarks which 
have both right-handed and left-handed polarizations. 
%We can add SU(2)-invariant terms to the Lagrangian. 
\begin{table}[htb] 
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c}
\hline 
      & $T_3$ & Y \\
\hline \hline 
$\left(  \begin{array}{c} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{array} \right)$      & $\displaystyle  \frac{1}{2} $ & -1 \\

\hline 
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:su2Qnum}
\caption{$\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L} \otimes \textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$ quantum numbers}
\end{table}
Tab.~\ref{tab:su2Qnum} shows the quantum numbers of  
$\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L} \otimes \textrm{U(1)}_\textrm{Y}$
for the left-handed electron doublet, right-handed neutrino, right-handed electron and 
Higgs doublet. Electron can be replaced by muon or tau leptons. 
From the table, one can see that the interaction such as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
e_R + \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) 
\rightarrow 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
conserves quantum numbers. Now the structure of the interaction is given, and
we specify its strength with $g_e$. Including the hermitian conjugate 
to the Lagrangian, the lepton-Higgs interaction term becomes 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, lepton} 
&=& 
-g_e \left[ 
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{\nu}_L & \bar{e}_L \end{array} \right)
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) e_R
+ 
\bar{e}_R
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{\phi}_+  & \bar{\phi}_0 \end{array} \right) 
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \nu_L \\ e_L \end{array} \right)
\right].
\end{eqnarray} 
Using the chosen Higgs field in eq.~(\ref{eq:HiggsfieldSSB}), 
%$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} 0 \\ v + H(x) \end{array} \right)$, 
the Lagrangian is calculated to be 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, lepton} 
&=& 
-\frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L \right)  
-\frac{g_e H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L \right). 
\end{eqnarray}
Since $\bar{e}e = \bar{e}(P_L^2+P_R^2)e = \bar{e}_L e_R + \bar{e}_R e_L$ where
$P_L$ and $P_R$ are projection operators, the first term, 
$\displaystyle -\frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{e}e$, corresponds to the mass term for the electron. 
Thus, the mass is identified to be 
\begin{eqnarray} 
m_e = \frac{g_e v}{\sqrt{2}}.
\end{eqnarray} 
Rewriting the Lagrangian in terms of $m_e$ instead of an arbitary $g_e$, we get 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int} 
&=& 
- m_e \bar{e}e  -\frac{m_e}{v} \bar{e}e H. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Since there isn't a physical motivation for $g_e$, $m_e$ is not calculable 
by theory, but needs to be determined by experiments. The second term 
corresponds to lepton-Higgs interaction. The size of the interaction 
is proportional to the mass of electrons. Thus, light leptons have very 
weak couplings to the Higgs field. For example, electron has 
%$\displaystyle \frac{m_e}{v} = \frac{0.5~\MeV}{246~\GeV} \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-6}\right)$
%and muon has $\displaystyle \frac{106~\MeV}{246~\GeV} \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$.
$m_e/v = 0.5~\MeV/246~\GeV \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-6}\right)$
and muon has $m_\mu / v = 106~\MeV/246~\GeV \sim \mathcal{O}\left(10^{-3}\right)$.

The case for quarks is more complicated due to the presence of right-handed up-type 
quarks as opposed to the lepton case. In order to generate masses for up-type 
quarks, we need a new Higgs doublet 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\phi_c 
= i \sigma_2 \phi^* 
=  \left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_0^* \\ -\phi_- \end{array} \right) 
=  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(  \begin{array}{c} v + H(x) \\ 0 \end{array} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
The new Higgs field is invariant under $\textrm{SU(2)}_\textrm{L}$ transformation and has Y = -1. 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{L}_{int, quark} 
&=& 
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{\displaystyle 
-g_{d} \left[ 
\left(  \begin{array}{cc} \bar{u}_L & \bar{d}_L \end{array} \right)
\left(  \begin{array}{c} \phi_+  \\ \phi_0 \end{array} \right) d_R  \right]
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hspace{2cm} \displaystyle

+ h.c. 
} \end{array}   \\ 
%&=& 
%-\frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{d}_L d_R + \bar{d}_R d_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_d H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{d}_L d_R + \bar{d}_R d_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{u}_L u_R + \bar{u}_R u_L \right)  
%-\frac{g_u H}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \bar{u}_L u_R + \bar{u}_R u_L \right) \\
&=&  
-\frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{d}d - \frac{g_d H}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{d}d  
-\frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{u}u - \frac{g_u H}{\sqrt{2}} \bar{u}u \\
&=&  
- m_d \bar{d}d  -\frac{m_d}{v} \bar{d}d H
- m_u \bar{u}u  -\frac{m_u}{v} \bar{u}u H
\end{eqnarray} 
where $u$ and $d$ are up-type and down-type quarks, respectivley, and   
\begin{eqnarray} 
m_d = \frac{g_d v}{\sqrt{2}} \quad \textrm{ and } \quad   
m_u = \frac{g_u v}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{eqnarray} 
are used as the lepton case. The h.c. means hermitian conjugate of the first two terms. 

As a result, the strength of interaction depends on the fermion mass, $m_f / v$.

\section{Production and Decay of Higgs Boson}


\subsection{Production of Higgs Boson}

At LHC, the Standard Model Higgs boson is generated by 4 major processes, 
gluon-gluon fusion (\ggH), 
vector boson fusion (\qqH),
associated production with vector bosons (\qqVH) and 
associated production with heavy quarks(\ttH).
The corresponding Fenyman diagrams are shown in fig.~\ref{fig:FD_HiggsProduction}.
\begin{figure}[htp] 
\centering 
\begin{tabular}{c} 
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/FD_HiggsProduction.pdf}

\caption{Feynman diagrams for SM Higgs production, (a) \ggH, (b) \qqVH, (c) \qqH\ and (d) \ttH.} 
\label{fig:FD_HiggsProduction} 
\end{figure} 
Since H does not couple to gluon in ggH process it is produced via a loop of 
heavy quarks, \textit{i.e.,} top and bottom quarks.
At LHC \ggH\ has the largest production rate because gluons have 
the largest probability to collide which is given by parton distribution function(PDF), 
and top quark has very large coupling to Higgs boson.

production mode. %\cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}. 
The \ggH\ and \qqH\ processes are 
calculated in complex-pole-scheme (CPS)~\cite{}, while other WH/ZH and ttH processes 
are calculated in zero-width-approximation (ZWA)~\cite{}. }
\label{fig:Higgs_XS_8TeV_LM200}
\end{figure*}

At the hadron colliders the hadronic cross section($\sigma$) is calculated with 
parton-level cross-section ($\hat{\sigma}$) convoluted with PDF, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma (pp \rightarrow H+X) 
= 
\sum_{i,j} \int dx_1 dx_2 f_i(x_1) f_j(x_2) 
\hat{\sigma} \left( ij \rightarrow H+X \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where i and j are colliding partons, 
$x_1$ and $x_2$ are the longitudinal momentum fractions carried by parton i and j. 
Each component in the equation is subject to the following uncertainties.
The partonic cross section is calculated at given
a renormalizaion scale $\mu_R$ and a factorization scale $\mu_F$. 
Due to possible missing higher-order QCD radiative corrections,
the uncertainty is estimated by varying the scales around 
the central values. In the de Florian and Grazzini (dFG) 
calculation [ref], the central values are chosen to be $\mu_0 = \mHi$. 
The scales $\mu_R$ and $\mu_F$ are varied in the range 
%$\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\mu_0 < \mu_F, \mu_R < 2\mu_0$ 
$\mu_0/2 < \mu_F, \mu_R < 2\mu_0$ 
%with a constraint $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2} < \frac{\mu_F}{\mu_R} < 2$. 
with a constraint $1/2 < \mu_F/\mu_R < 2$. 
PDF is obtained by fitting on data measured in deep-inelastic scattering, 
Drell-Yan, and jet production from a wide variety of different experiments~\cite{}. 
The accuracy on those data can introduce uncertainty on PDF calculation. 
In addition, strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ is used in DGLAP evolution [ref] 
to the higher $Q^2$ region. Thus, its uncertainty also contributes to 
the total cross section. There are other uncertainties due to 
the EW corrections, the different choice of top and bottom quark masses, 
and the use of large-$m_T$ method. But, the effect to the 
hadronic cross section is less than a few percent \cite{Dittmaier:2012vm}
for \ggH.

Figure \ref{fig:Higgs_XS_8TeV_LM200} shows the hadronic cross sections 
as a function of \mHi\ for SM Higgs production and uncertainty 
in different production modes. The \ggH\ and \qqH\ cross sections 
are based on complex-pole-scheme (CPS), while VH and ttH ones 
are based on zero-width-approximation (ZWA).

The highest order of QCD and EW calculations are summarized in Table

of uncertainties from QCD scale varitaion and PDF+$\alpha_S$.
At $\mHi=125~\GeV$ \ggH\ contributes $\sim 87 \%$ to the total cross section.

\subsection{Decay of Higgs Boson}
\label{sec:decayHiggs}

Fig.~\ref{fig:fd_HVterm} shows that the Higgs boson can 
couple to a pair of weak bosons. Thus, Higgs can directly decay into $W^+W^-$ and $ZZ$.
Depending on \mHi, one or two of the bosons can be off-shell. 
As shown in~\cite{Djouadi20081}, at $\mHi>2m_W$ both bosons 
tend to be on-shell, and at $110<\mHi<2m_W$ one of them is on-shell 
while the other is off-shell. Below 110~\GeV\ there is a sizable contribution 
from the case where both bosons are off-shell, but this is not relevant 
to this analysis. Thus, we discuss two cases where both of them are on-shell$(VV)$, 
and one is on-shell and the other is off-shell$(VV^*)$. 

%
\subsubsection{Both bosons are on shell : $H \rightarrow VV$}
When both bosons are on-shell($ H \rightarrow VV$), 
the decay width at tree-level is given by~\cite{PhysRevD.49.79}
\begin{eqnarray} 
\Gamma \left( H \rightarrow VV \right) 
= 
\frac{\gf \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \delta_V \sqrt{1-4\epsilon^2} 
\left( 1 - 4\epsilon^2 + 12\epsilon^4 \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\displaystyle \epsilon = \frac{m_V}{\mHi}$ and $\delta_W=2$ and $\delta_Z=1$.
At high \mHi, the decay width to WW is reduced to 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\Gamma \left( H \rightarrow WW \right)
&\rightarrow&
\frac{\gf \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \times 2 \\
&=&  
2 \frac{ 1.16637 \times 10^{-5}~\GeV^{-2} \mHi^3}{16\sqrt{2\pi}} \\
&\approx&
0.33 \mHi \times \frac{\mHi^2}{\TeV^2} (\TeV).   
\end{eqnarray} 
For example, at $\mHi=1~\TeV$, decay width for WW is 0.33 \TeV.
Practically, it is hard to claim a Higgs resonance at high mass regions.  

The ratio of londitudinal polarization is given by \cite{PhysRevD.49.79}
\begin{eqnarray} 
R_L 
= 
\frac{\Gamma_L}{\Gamma_T + \Gamma_L}    
= 
\frac{1 - 4\epsilon^2 + 4\epsilon^4}{1 - 4\epsilon^2 + 12\epsilon^4} 
\xrightarrow{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}\ 1.
\end{eqnarray} 
Thus, vector bosons are longitudinally polarized at high \mHi\ ($\epsilon \rightarrow 0$). 
%At the production threshold, $\displaystyle \mHi = 2m_V \rightarrow \epsilon = \frac{1}{2}$, 
At the production threshold, $\displaystyle \mHi = 2m_V$ ($\epsilon = 1/2$), 
$R_L$ is 1/3 which means that the longitudinal and the transverse polarizations are populated 
with a ratio of 1:2. This is shown in the fig.~\ref{fig:HVV_polarization_ratio}.

%
\subsubsection{One boson is on-shell and other is off-shell : 
               $H \rightarrow VV^* \rightarrow Vf\bar{f}$}
When one boson is on-shell and the other is off-shell
($ H \rightarrow VV^* \rightarrow Vf\bar{f}$), % where $f$ does not include top quark),
the decay width at tree-level is given by~\cite{PhysRevD.49.79}
\begin{eqnarray} 
\Gamma \left( H \rightarrow VV^* \right) 
=
\frac{3\gf^2 m_V^4}{16\pi^3} \mHi \delta_V' R(\epsilon)
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\delta_W'=1$, $\displaystyle \delta_Z'=\frac{7}{12}-\frac{10}{9}\sin^2\theta_W 
+ \frac{40}{9}\sin^4\theta_W$ and 
\begin{eqnarray}   
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{\displaystyle 
R(\epsilon) = \frac{3(1-8\epsilon^2+20\epsilon^4)}{(4\epsilon^2-1)^{1/2}} 
                \arccos \left( \frac{3\epsilon^2-1}{2\epsilon^3} \right)  
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hspace{1.5cm} \displaystyle
- (1-\epsilon^2)\left( \frac{47}{2}\epsilon^2 - \frac{13}{2} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \right)  
- 3(1-6\epsilon^2+4\epsilon^4) \ln \epsilon.
} \end{array}      
\end{eqnarray} 

The ratio of londitudinal polarization is given \cite{PhysRevD.49.79} by 
\begin{eqnarray} 
R_L 
=
\frac{\Gamma_L}{\Gamma_T + \Gamma_L}    
= 
\frac{R_L(\epsilon)}{R(\epsilon)}  
\end{eqnarray} 
where $R_L$ is \cite{PhysRevD.49.79} 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\begin{array}{ccc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{\displaystyle 
R_L(\epsilon) = \frac{3(1-16\epsilon^2+20\epsilon^4)}{(4\epsilon^2-1)^{1/2}} 
                \arccos \left( \frac{3\epsilon^2-1}{2\epsilon^3} \right)  
} & \\ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\hspace{1.5cm} \displaystyle
- (1-\epsilon^2)\left( \frac{15}{2}\epsilon^2 - \frac{13}{2} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} \right)  
- (3-10\epsilon^2+4\epsilon^4) \ln \epsilon.
} \end{array}      
\end{eqnarray}

\label{fig:HVV_polarization_ratio}
\end{figure*}
Figure~\ref{fig:HVV_polarization_ratio} shows the fraction of longitudinal $VV(*)$ decays 
%as a function of $\displaystyle \frac{\mHi}{2m_V}$
as a function of $\mHi/2m_V$(=$\displaystyle \frac{\epsilon}{2}$). 
As discussed in the VV decay, the fraction goes to 1 at high \mHi\ and 
to 1/3 at the production threshold, $\mHi = 2m_V$.
Below the threshold, the fraction of longitudinal polarization 
increases up to 0.6 at $\mHi/2m_V \approx 0.8 \rightarrow \mHi \approx 130~\GeV$,
and decreases slightly as \mHi\ becomes smaller. 
As the fraction of decay to longitudinally polarized bosons depends on \mHi, 
and the event kinematics depends on the fraction as well, 
it is important to optimize analysis for a given \mHi\ to maximize sensitivity.

Figure \ref{fig:YRHXS2_BR_Fig1} shows the branching ratios of Standard 
Model Higgs boson(left) and its total decay width(right). The partial widths of each

taken into account~\cite{Dittmaier:1318996}. The band on the left plots

\section{Limits on Higgs Boson Mass} 

\subsection{Theoretical Limits} 

\subsubsection{Perturbative Unitarity : $W_L^+W_L^- \rightarrow W_L^+W_L^-$}

The cross section of longditudinal vector boson scattering, $V_LV_L \to V_LV_L$, 
increases as the energy increases, and it eventually violates unitarity, 
\textit{i.e.}, probability for this process to happen is larger than unity.

\caption{Feynman diagrams for $W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^-$ scattering.} 
\label{fig:FD_unitary}
\end{figure*}
Fig.~\ref{fig:FD_unitary} shows Feynman diagrams for $W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^-$. 
There are 4-point interaction, and t-channel and s-channel interactions mediated 
by $Z/\gamma^*$ or Higgs boson.
In the high energy limit $s \gg \mW^2$, the scattering amplitude becomes \cite{Djouadi20081} 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:WWscat}
\mathcal{A}\left( W_L^+W_L^- \to W_L^+W_L^- \right) 
\sim 
- \frac{1}{v^2}  \left( -s - t + \frac{s^2}{s - \mHi^2} + \frac{t^2}{t - \mHi^2} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
%\textcolor{red}{What does the point diagram correspond to in this equation?
%look at Users/jaehyeok/Research/cms/References/Theory/0910.4182v4.pdf}  
According to the Electroweak Equivalence Theorem~\cite{He:1994br},  
at very high energy the longitudinal vector bosons can be replaced by 
their associated Goldstone bosons. Thus, the scattering amplitude can be written 
using Goldstone bosons ($w^\pm$)
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{A}\left( w^+w^- \to w^+w^- \right) 
= 
- \frac{\mHi^2}{v^2}  \left( 2 + \frac{\mHi^2}{s - \mHi^2} + \frac{\mHi^2}{t - \mHi^2} \right). 
\end{eqnarray} 
An scattering amplitude can be decomposed into partial waves $a_l$
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{A} = 16 \pi \sum_{i=0}^\infty 
              \left( 2l+1 \right) P_l \left( \cos \theta \right) a_l
\end{eqnarray} 
where $P_l$ is the Legendre polynominals and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.
For the cross section of $2 \to 2$ processes, we have the 
following identity on the cross section ($\sigma$) by Optical theorem \cite{optical}
\begin{eqnarray} 
\sigma 
= \frac{16 \pi}{s} \sum_{i=0}^\infty  \left( 2l+1 \right) \left| a_l \right|^2 
= \frac{1}{s} Im \left[ \mathcal{A} \left(\theta = 0 \right)  \right]
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives the unitary condition, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\left| a_l \right|^2 = Im \left( a_l \right) 
\quad &\Rightarrow& \quad  
Re\left( a_l \right)^2 
+ \left[ Im\left( a_l \right)  - \frac{1}{2} \right]^2 
= \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 \\
\label{eq:unitaryWW}
\quad &\Rightarrow& \quad 
\left| Re \left( a_l \right) \right| < \frac{1}{2}.   
\end{eqnarray} 
Then, the $l=0$ amplitude in the limit of $ s \gg \mHi^2$ becomes  
\begin{eqnarray} 
a_0\left( w^+w^- \to w^+w^- \right)  
&=&  
- \frac{\mHi^2}{16\pi v^2}  
\left[ 2 + \frac{\mHi^2}{s - \mHi^2} 
       - \frac{\mHi^2}{s} \log \left( 1 + \frac{s}{\mHi^2} \right) \right]  \\
&\rightarrow&
- \frac{\mHi^2}{8\pi v^2} 
\end{eqnarray} 
The unitary condition (Eq. (\ref{eq:unitaryWW})) gives upper bound on \mHi, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\left| Re \left( a_0 \right) \right| 
&=&  \frac{\mHi^2}{8\pi v^2} < \frac{1}{2} \\ 
&\Rightarrow& 
\mHi < 2 \sqrt{\pi} v \simeq 870~\GeV. 
\end{eqnarray} 
Including other scattering channels, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
Z_LZ_L, \,\,\, HH, \,\,\, Z_LH, \,\,\, W_L^+H, \,\,\, W^+_LZ_L 
\end{eqnarray} 
the constraint on \mHi\ becomes tighter as~\cite{Djouadi20081}, 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:unitaryAll}
\mHi < 710~\GeV.
\end{eqnarray}
This means that in the standard model unitariry will be violated if $\mHi>710~\GeV$
unless there is a new physics that cures this problem. 

So far we calculated only tree-level terms, so we can expect that adding 
higher order terms can solve this problem. But, including higher order 
terms does not gaurantee that the unitary will be restored because 
in the high \mHi\ regime coupling to Higgs is too large and perturbative 
calculation breaks down. Thus, the mass bound given in eq.~(\ref{eq:unitaryAll})  
can be considered the \mHi~regime where perturbative calculation is reliable 
in all $s$.

\subsubsection{Triviality and Stability bounds}
% Triviality

\caption{Feynman diagrams for Higgs boson quartic interaction. Left is tree lebel and 
the right three are one-loop correction by Higgs boson itself.} 
\label{fig:FD_triviality} 
\end{figure*} 
The variation of the Higgs quartic couping $\lambda$ is described by 
Renormalization Group Equation (RGE). 
When we consider one-loop radiation corrections by Higgs boson itself 
to $\lambda$ as shown in fig.~\ref{fig:FD_triviality}, 
the corresponding RGE is given by \cite{Djouadi20081} 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\frac{d}{dQ^2} \lambda (Q^2) 
= 
\frac{3}{4\pi^2} \lambda^2(Q^2) + \textrm{higher orders} 
\end{eqnarray} 
The solution to this equation is given by 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\displaystyle  \lambda(Q^2) = \frac{\lambda(v^2)} {\left[\displaystyle   1 - \frac{3}{4\pi^2} \lambda(v^2) \log{\frac{Q^2}{v^2}}\right] } 
\end{eqnarray} 
where the EWSB scale is used as a reference energy point, $Q_0 = v$. 

If the energy is much smaller than the EWSB scale, $Q^2\ll v^2$, 
the quadratic coupling goes to 0, and the theory is called 
``trivial", which means that there is no interaction. 
On the otherhand, if the energy is much larger than the EWSB scale, $Q^2\gg v^2$,
as Q increases the coupling will be infinite at a certain energy scale, $\Lambda_{cut}$. 
Using $\lambda = \mHi^2/2v^2$ and the defition of $\lambda$ that it is positive, 
we have the following equation for denominator,
\begin{eqnarray} 
1 > \frac{3}{4\pi^2} \frac{\mHi^2}{2v^2} \log{\frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2}} 
\qquad \Rightarrow  \qquad 
\mHi^2 > \frac{8\pi^2v^2}{\log{\displaystyle  \frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2}}},
\end{eqnarray} 
which gives a scale-dependent bound on \mHi. Imposing $\Lambda_{cut} = \mHi$ 
which means that the theory is not reliable, \textit{i.e.}, valid scale of the theory is same 
as the mass of a particle, the bound on the Higgs mass is $\mHi < 640~\GeV$. 
This result is consistent with the limit from unitarity constraint. 
\\

% Stability 
In the previous discussion, only was one-loop correction by Higgs itself considered.
This is a proper approximation when $\lambda$ is large, but
when $\lambda$ is small, we need to consider the contributions from fermions 
and vector bosons. Since, the strength of interaction with Higgs boson is proportional 
to the particle mass, we consider only heavy particles, vector bosons and top quarks.   

In the limit of small Higgs quartic couplings, $\lambda \ll \lambda_t, g_1, g_2$ 
where $\lambda_t$ is the top Yukawa coupling given by $\sqrt{2} \mt / v$, the RGE is 
given by \cite{Djouadi20081}
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:stability_ddlogQ2}
\frac{d}{dQ^2} \lambda (Q^2)  
\simeq
\frac{1}{16\pi^2}  
\left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right)   \right].
\end{eqnarray} 
Taking EWSB scale as the reference point, the solution to Eq.~(\ref{eq:stability_ddlogQ2}) is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\lambda\left(Q^2\right) 
= 
\lambda\left(v^2\right)  
+ 
\frac{1}{16\pi^2}  \left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} 
                          + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right) \right]
                    \log \frac{Q^2}{v^2}.
\end{eqnarray} 
As $\lambda(v^2)$ becomes small, the couping can go negative, leading the vacuum unstable.   
Thus, in order to maintain the stability of vacuum, $\lambda\left(Q^2\right)$ should be 
positive. This requirement gives
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mHi^2 
&>&
\frac{v^2}{8\pi^2}  \left[ -12 \frac{\mt^4}{v^4} 
                          + \frac{3}{16} \left(2g_2^4 + \left(g_2^2+g_1^2\right)^2 \right) \right]
                    \log \frac{\Lambda_{cut}^2}{v^2} 
\end{eqnarray} 
%
\begin{figure*}[t]

\caption{ Upper and lower bound of \mHi as a function of $\Lambda_{cut}$.
}
\label{fig:trivial_vacstab}
\end{figure*}
\\

So far the higher order contributions were taken up to 1-loop corrections. 
There are calculations up to 2-loops and Fig. \ref{fig:trivial_vacstab} 
shows lower bound (vacuum stability) and upper bound (triviality) of \mHi\ 
as a function of cutoff scale, $\Lambda_{cut}$~\cite{}.

%
\subsubsection{Fine tuning}
The 1-loop radiative corrections to \mHi\ when only are W/Z/H and top contributions 
condsidered are given by \cite{Djouadi20081}
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mHi^2 
= 
\left( \mHi^0 \right)^2 + \frac{3 \Lambda^2}{8\pi^2v^2} 
\left[ \mHi^2 + 2\mW^2 + \mZ^2- 4 \mt^2 \right] 
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\mHi^0$ is the fundamental parameter of SM, $\Lambda$ is the 
cutoff scale, and $\mW, \mZ, \mt$ are W, Z, top mass, respectively. 
Therefore, unless $\Lambda$ is in the same scale of 
EWSB($100~\GeV - 1~\TeV$), there should be an incredible fine-tuning between 
$\mHi^0$ and the radiative correction to have \mHi\ in the EWSB scale.  

For a quantitative discussion, we first need to define what fine-tuning means. 
Fine-tuning is defined as the sensitivity of the weak scale to
the cutoff, $\left| \delta \mW^2(\Lambda) / \mW^2 \right|$, where $\delta \mW^2$ is the 
difference between the tree and loop values, with all other quantities held fixed 
\cite{Kolda:2000wi}.
So, the metric, $\mathcal{F}$, is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mathcal{F}
= \left| \frac{\delta \mW^2}{\mW^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta v^2}{v^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta \mu^2}{\mu^2} \right|
= \left| \frac{\delta \mHi^2}{\mHi^2} \right|
= \frac{2\Lambda^2}{\mHi^2} \left| \sum_{n} 
  \log^2\left( \frac{\Lambda}{\mHi} \right) \right| 
\end{eqnarray} 
and $\mathcal{F} \le 1$ represents that there is no fine-tuning. 

\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/finetuning.pdf}
\caption{Constraint contour from fine tuning, vacuum stability, and triviality}.
\label{fig:finetuning}
\end{figure*}

The fig.~\ref{fig:finetuning} \cite{Kolda:2000wi} shows two regions in $[\Lambda,\mHi]$ plane
where $\Lambda$ is the cutoff scale; 
$\mathcal{F}>10$ in light-hatching (labeled as $10~\%$)
and $\mathcal{F}>100$ in thick-hatching (labeled as $1~\%$).  
In case of light Higgs scenario, the fine-tuning is required even at the low energy scale. 
For example, at \mHi=130 \GeV\ the fine-tuning of $\mathcal{F}>10$ requires 
$\Lambda<2.3~\TeV$. This means that new physics should exist in the regime where 
LHC experiements can probe.

\subsection{Experimental Limits}

\subsubsection{Indirect search} 

There are electroweak measurements sensitive to \mHi. 
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{figures/FD_Wmass_Hloop.pdf}
\caption{Feynman diagram for 1 loop correctioin by Higgs boson to the W propagator.}.
\label{fig:FD_Wmass_Hloop}
\end{figure*}
For example, the mass of W boson has one-loop correction of Higgs boson 
as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FD_Wmass_Hloop}. Its contribution to the W mass 
is parametrized by $\Delta r$ in the following equation~\cite{Djouadi20081} % page 41
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mW^2 
= 
\frac{\pi\alpha}{\sqrt{2} \gf} 
\frac{1}{\left( 1 - \frac{\mW^2}{\mZ^2} \right)} 
\left( 1 + \Delta r \right),
\end{eqnarray} 
and the correction is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta r \simeq 
\frac{\gf \mW^2}{8 \sqrt{2} \pi^2} \frac{11}{3} 
\left( \log \frac{\mHi^2}{\mW^2} - \frac{5}{6} \right)
\end{eqnarray} 
which is depedent on \mHi\ logarithmically. Thus, by measuring other quantities 
in the equation, we can constrain \mHi\ up to the uncertainties to the measured 
quantities. Going one step further, we can use more variables, not only \mW, 
and put them into a statisitcal fit \cite{LEP-2}. A simultaneous fit is done to
$\Delta \alpha_{had}^{(5)}(\mZ^2)$, $\alpha_S(\mZ^2)$,  
\mZ, \mt, and  $\log_{10} \left( \mHi \right)$
on the data collected by LEP-I/II, SLD, and Tevatron \cite{LEP-2}.

the upper limit on \mHi at C.L. = 95 \% is 152 \GeV.

\subsubsection{Direct search}  

Before 2012, there were direct searches for SM Higgs boson by LEP, Tevatron, 
and LHC experiments. 
The LEP data showed upper limit of $\mHi<114.4~\GeV$ at \CLs = 95 \% \cite{Beringer:1900zz} 
and the Tevatron showed exclusion of SM Higgs hypothesis in the range of 
$147~\GeV < \mHi < 179~\GeV$ at \CLs = 95 \% \cite{Beringer:1900zz}. 
At the end of 2011, the LHC experiments(CMS and ATLAS) showed their results with 7~\TeV\ data
on the standard model Higgs search \cite{Chatrchyan201226,Aad201249}.

\label{fig:2011HiggsExp}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:2011HiggsExp} shows the 95\% C.L. upper limits on $\sigma/\sigma_{\textrm{SM}}$
as a function of \mHi\ in the range of 110 - 145 \GeV\ for CMS on the left and 
110 - 150 \GeV\ for ATLAS on the right. In both experiments, search was performed up to 
\mHi = 600 \GeV, but only low \mHi\ region is shown on the plots. 
In CMS, the observed exclusion range is 118 - 543 \GeV\ 
with expected exclusion range is 127 - 600 \GeV.     
In ATLAS, the observed exclusion range is 112.9 - 115.5, 131-238, and 251-466 \GeV\ 
with expected exclusion range 124 - 519 \GeV.  
Both experiments, CMS and ATLAS, showed local excess of 
$3.1\sigma$ and $3.5\sigma$, repectively, around \mHi = 125 \GeV.

\section{The \hww\ channel} 

%
\subsection{Large production rate}

The \hww\ channel has a good statistical power to measure $\sigma \times BR$.
Fig.~\ref{fig:XSBR_8TeV_SM_LM} shows $\sigma \times BR$ at $\mHi<250~\GeV$.
\begin{figure*}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figures/XSBR_8TeV_SM_LM.eps}
\caption{$\sigma \times BR$ at low \mHi.}
\label{fig:XSBR_8TeV_SM_LM}
\end{figure*}
It shows that the $\sigma \times \textrm{BR}$ of \hww\ channel 
is large compared to the other sensitive channels, $H \rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4l$
and $H \rightarrow\gamma\gamma$. 
\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c | c c c}
\hline 
        & $H \rightarrow WW \rightarrow 2l2\nu$   & $H \rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4l$ 
        & $H \rightarrow\gamma\gamma$  \\
\hline \hline 
$\sigma \times BR (pb)$  
        & $2.24\times10^{-1}$ &  $2.79\times10^{-3}$ & $5.09\times10^{-2}$ \\ 
$N_{expected}$ in $\mathcal{L}_{int} = 20~\ifb$ 
        & 4480 &  56 & 1018 \\ 
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:XSBR_8TeV_SM_125}
\caption{$\sigma \times BR$ at $\mHi=125~\GeV$ for most sensitive channels 
and the expected number of events in $\mathcal{L}_{int} = 20~\ifb$.
$l$ means electrons or muons.}
\end{table}
Table \ref{tab:XSBR_8TeV_SM_125} shows $\sigma \times \textrm{BR}$ for 
the most sensitive channels, \hww, $H \rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4l$
and $H \rightarrow\gamma\gamma$, and the expected signal events at
the integrated luminosity, $\mathcal{L}=20~\ifb$. The expected signal 
events are 4480, 56 and 1018 for \hww, $H \rightarrow ZZ\rightarrow 4l$
and $H \rightarrow\gamma\gamma$, respectively. This allows to have a 
good statistical power to measure the $\sigma \times \textrm{BR}$
with this channel.

\subsection{Angular distribution of leptons in the final state}

The spin of SM Higgs is zero, so by helicity conservation the total spin 
of the WW system should be zero as well. 
\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/HiggsSpin.pdf}
\caption{Spin configuration of Higgs boson decaying to $W^+W^-$ in the CM frame of Higgs.
Solid black arrows represent momentum direction of Ws and grey arrows indicate 
the spin configuration.}
\label{fig:HiggsSpin}
\end{figure}
As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HiggsSpin}, if we take 
the direction of $W^+$ momentum as z axis in the center-of-mass(CM) frame of Higgs boson,
there are two cases where the spin direction is parellel to the 
momentum direction (transverse polarization) and one case where 
it is perpendicular to the momentum direction(longitudinal polarization). 
In case of transverse polarization, the leptons from Ws have strong 
angular dependence due to V-A nature of weak decays, i.e. neutrinos 
are always left-handed(anti-neutrinos are always right-handed). 
Let's take the case of $W^+$ spin in the z direction as an example.
In order for the neutrino from $W^+$ to be left-handed, the direction 
of the neutrino should be in the - z direction, thus lepton should 
fly to z direction. In order for the anti-neutrino from $W^-$ to be 
right-handed, the direction of the anti-neutrino should be in the 
- z direction, thus lepton should fly to z direction.
Therefore, both leptons tend to move in the same direction 
resulting the angle between the two leptons to be small. 
This is somewhat diluted due to boost of Higgs and Ws, 
but the effect is still visible and used to separate signals 
from non-resonant WW background. 
On the other hand, in case of longitudinal polarization, 
no specific angular correlation is present. 
As discussed in section~\ref{sec:decayHiggs}, the fraction of longitudinal 
polairzation depends on the Higgs mass. So, we expect that the two leptons 
in the final state tend to be more aligned at \mHi\ where the fraction of longitudinal 
polarization is small.

\subsection{Kinematic variables}
\label{subsec:kinimetic_variables}

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/hww_gen_all.pdf}
\caption{Kinematic distributions of \ptlmax, \ptlmin, \delphill, \mll\ and \mT, 
for $\mHi = 110, 125, 145, 160\textrm{ and } 200~\GeV$ at the generator level.}
\label{fig:genhww}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:genhww} shows distributions of kinematic variables for 
multiple Higgs hypotheses, $\mHi = 110, 125, 145, 160\textrm{ and } 200~\GeV$. 
The plotted variables are leading and trailing lepton \pt (\ptlmax, \ptlmin), 
azimuthal angle difference between the two leptons (\delphill), 
di-lepton invariant mass (\mll), and Higgs transverse mass (\mT) which is 
defined as 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\mT = \sqrt{2\ptll\met(1-cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell-\met}))}
\end{eqnarray} 
where \ptll\ is transverse momentum of the di-lepton system, 
\met\ is missing transverse momentum, and  
$\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell-\met}$ is the angle between the momentum of di-lepton
system and \met\ in the transverse plane.
Most of the events have \ptlmax\ greater than 20~\GeV\ for all \mHi\ hypotheses. 
\ptlmin\ is quite populated at low \ptlmin\ region, especially for low \mHi\ 
hypotheses. In case of \mHi = 125~\GeV, approximately 25 \% of 
events are rejected by requiring $\ptlmin>10~\GeV$. 
\delphill\ shows non-straightforward trend. The angle tends to get smaller 
as \mHi\ increases up to 160 \GeV, and the angle becomes wide 
after \mHi = 160~\GeV. This behavior was expected in the 
fig.~\ref{fig:HVV_polarization_ratio} where the fraction of the 
longitudinal polarization is at the minimum at \mHi = 2\mW\ which is about 160~\GeV. 
Since small \delphill\ yields small \mll\, we expect small \mll\ 
for low \mHi\ hypotheses. The Higgs transverse mass \mT\ shows clear 
drop at \mHi.

\subsection{CMS \hww\ result before 2012}

Before 2012, 4.6 \ifb\ of data at $\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$ collected by CMS detector 
was analyzed for SM Higgs search in \hww\ channel~\cite{Chatrchyan201291}. 
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/limits_nj_shape.pdf}
\caption{ Exclusion limit of SM Higgs with 2011 data($\sqrt{s}=7~\TeV$, $\mathcal{L}=4.6~\ifb$ ).
The observed(expected) exclusion limit at CL  = 95 \% is \mHi = 129 - 270(127 - 270) \GeV.}
\label{fig:hww2011}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:hww2011} shows exclusion limit of SM Higgs boson 
using a multivariate technique based on the boosted decision tree(BDT) algorithm~\cite{}.
The observed exclusion limit at \CLs  = 95 \% is \mHi\ = 129 - 270 \GeV\
with expected limit \mHi\ = 127 - 270 \GeV. There is a slight overall excess 
in low \mHi\ region which might indicate existence of SM Higgs boson at low \mHi.
