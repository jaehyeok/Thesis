Due to the rapid rise in the instantaneous luminosity at LHC, 
the data taking conditions have changed rapidly. 
In particular it is difficult to exactly reproduce the number of pileup 
between data and simulation, and thus there will be differences in the 
number of reconstructed primary vertices. 
We correct this disagreement by reweighting the simulation 
to match the number of pileup events in data.

When the collisions happen, 
events are recorded when the they pass the trigger requirements. 
Thus, per event trigger efficiency needs to be measured using data. 
To select identified and isolated leptons from Higgs events, we require 
that each lepton meet strict offline criteria. To account for the possible difference
of offline selection efficiencies in simulation and data, we need to measure it 
in simultion and data, and apply corrections to the simulation. 

The analysis is optimized in the different categories of number of jets. 
But, jet counting efficiency which is defined as the fraction 
of events in the certain category
%$\displaystyle  \epsilon_{0/1} = \frac{N_{njet=0/1}}{N_{njet\geq0}}$ 
can be different in simulation and data.  
This is important for the signal because we rely on the simulation 
to calculate the jet counting efficiency. 
So, we correct the efficiency of \hww\ in simulation by a data/simulation scale 
factor measured in simulation and data using \dyll~events.  

This chapter describes these auxiliary measurements.

\section{Pileup Re-weighting}

The target pileup distribution for data is generated using the instantaneous luminosity 
per bunch crossing for each luminosity section, and the total pp inelastic cross section 
of 69.4~mb, integrated over the full data-taking period. The source distribution is taken 
from \dyll\ simulation without applying any cuts.

\caption{Number of reconstructed primary vertices for data and simulation 
after the re-weighting procedure for the 2012 dataset.}
\label{fig:nvtx} 
\end{figure} 

Figure~\ref{fig:nvtx} shows the the number of reconstructed primary vertices 
from \dyll\ events in data and simulation after this re`weighting procedure. 
The residual differences reflect the size of the systematic uncertainty in the 
determination of the amount of pileup present in the data. 
Since the dependence of the efficiencies for selecting signal and background events 
on pileup are small, this systematic uncertainty due to the pileup is small when 
propagated to the final result.

\section{Lepton Efficiency}

The lepton selection efficiencies are measured using the Tag-And-Probe 
method~\cite{Abulencia:2005ix}. It uses 
$Z/\gamma^* \rightarrow e^+e^-$ or $Z/\gamma^* \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ events 
that pass the single-lepton trigger to select a unbiased sample of prompt leptons.  
One lepton which is called ``tag" is required to pass the single lepton trigger 
and the full offline selection. By requiring the full selection on the tag, 
we can enhance the purity of the sample. The other lepton which is called 
``probe" is required to pass a set of selection criteria that enhances the purity 
of the sample while leaving the crieteria under study unbiased. The fact that the tag 
passed single-lepton trigger guarantees that the probe is not biased by triggers. 
Both legs can be used as a tag in the offline lepton selection efficiency measurement 
while only can one of them be used in trigger efficiency measurement due to the correlation 
between the two onlie lepton objects in the double-lepton triggers. 

The offline selection efficiency is composed of identification(ID) and isolation(ISO) parts. 
We use the N-1 method where ID and ISO efficiencies are measured with respect to the other, 
and multiplied afterwards. When measuring the efficiency of the ID part ($\epsilon_{ID}$) 
the probe is required to pass the full isolation requirement, and when measuring 
the efficiency of the ISO part ($\epsilon_{ISO}$) the probe is required to pass 
the full identification requirement. The efficiency is measured in the bins of 
\pt\ and \Eta\ in order to account for the dependences on the kinematics and 
the material budget of the detector. 

Requiring tight selections to the tag, and using the N-1 method gives a high-purity sample 
of $Z/\gamma^*$ events in data. However, there are residual contributions from 
non-prompt leptons from W+jets and QCD events especially at low $p_T$ bins. 
Thus, we extract yields by fitting the \mll~distribution of the tag and probe pair
with ``Gaussian $\oplus$ (exponential $\oplus$ error function)". 
The Gaussian function which is to describe the 
$Z/\gamma^*$ invariant mass peak is modeled by simulation, and 
gaussian smearings are applied to account for the difference in lepton momentum resolutions
between data and simulation. 
%\textcolor{red}{I don't believe this is true. Looking at the plots with fitted shapes, 
%it seems that there are more than one fit function. need to check in the code.}
The (exponential $\oplus$ error function) is for the backgrounds.
To allow enough sidebands for estimating backgrounds, the \mll~range is chosen to be 
$60~\GeV < \mll < 120~\GeV$. In case of simulation, efficiencies are calculated by 
counting events in $81~\GeV < \mll < 101~\GeV$. In addition, in order to select  
the leptons from $Z/\gamma^*$ only, the dR between 
the probe and the closest, same flavor, generator-level lepton after final-state-radiation(FSR)
is required to be within 0.2.

The data/simulation scale factors per event are then calculated by 
multiplying per lepton efficiencies measured in data and simulation, 
\begin{equation} 
\epsilon_{offline}^{event} 
= 
\epsilon_{ID}^{lepton1} \times \epsilon_{ISO}^{lepton1}   
\times \epsilon_{ID}^{lepton2} \times \epsilon_{ISO}^{lepton2}.   
\end{equation} 
The trigger efficiency($\epsilon_{trigger}$) is measured with respect to the full 
offline selection. Finally, the simulation is corrected by applying the 
offline selection scale factor and the trigger efficiency, 
\begin{equation} 
\frac{\epsilon_{offline, data}^{event}}{\epsilon_{offline, simulation}^{event}} 
\times \epsilon_{trigger}. 
\end{equation} 

In the N-1 method, a possible bias due to the correlation between 
the ID and the ISO requirements is estimated by comparing efficiencies 
measured by N-1 method and combined measurement of ID+ISO efficiency in simulation. 
The difference which ranges from 0 to 8~\% depending 
on the kinemtic bins of the probe is assigned as systematic uncertainty of the method.  
In addition, the uncertainty of lepton reconstruction efficiency is taken 
as a systmetic sourse.

\subsection{Electron Selection Efficiency}
\label{sec:electroneff}

The electron efficiency is composed of two factors, the recontruction efficiency and 
the selection efficiency. The reconstruction efficiency is the probability for a 
super-cluster energy deposit to be matched to a reconstructed ECAL-driven 
GSF electron. In this analysis, we use the result measured with 2010 
data~\cite{Khachatryan:2010xn}  
because new measurement has not made with the full 2012 data sample. 
The efficency is measured as a function 
of \pt~and \Eta~of a lepton. From the study, we assume that the reconstruction 
efficiency for an electron is unity with an uncertainty at the level of 2 \%.

\subsection{Muon Selection Efficiency}

As in the electron case, muon efficiency is composed of two factors, 
the recontruction efficiency and the selection efficiency. 
The reconstruction efficiency is the probability for a 
well-reconstructed track in the muon chamber to be matched to a reconstructed track 
in the inner tracker. In this analysis, we use the result measured with 2010 
data~\cite{Khachatryan:2010xn}   
because new measurement has not made with the full 2012 data sample. 
The efficency is measured as a function 
of \pt~and \Eta~of a lepton. From the study, we assume that the reconstruction 
efficiency for a muon is unity with uncertainty at the level of 1.5 \%.

Table \ref{tab:eff_muon_id} and \ref{tab:eff_muon_iso} show the muon N-1 efficiencies in 
data and simulation, and data-to-simulation scale factors for ID and ISO selections, respectively. 
The scale factors are close to unity in all bins. 

In case of muon, the systematic uncertainty due to N-1 method is negligible($<0.2~\%$)
compared to the recontruction efficiency which is at the level of $1.5~\%$.

\subsection{Trigger Efficiency}
\label{subsec:trg_eff}

The analysis uses a combination of the single-lepton and the double-lepton triggers.
For the double-lepton triggers, there is a requirement on dZ, the longditudinal distance 
between two lepton vertices, on top of the requirement on each leg. 
This requirement is imposed to select events from hard interactions, not 
from pileup events.
Only are events that pass both requirements recorded in the data sample under study. 
Thus, there is 100 \% correlation between the two leptons, \textit{i.e.} 
if one lepton passed the per lepton requirement, the other lepton passed it as well, 
otherwise trigger objects have not been stored at all in the data samples.  
This introduces a slight change in the Tag-And-Probe method such that only is one 
tag selected in an event, and we do it by selecting the tag randomly.

The dZ requirement for the double-lepton triggers is designed to be highly efficient. 
However, in the early part of data in 2012 there was a techinical issue that 
caused inefficiency of dZ requirement for the double-muon triggers at the level of 15 \%.   
The inefficiency is absorbed by using single-lepton triggers to a negligible level. 
Thus, in the per event trigger efficiency calculation we assume dZ efficiency is 100 \%.

The efficiency of the each leg of the double-lepton triggers is measured separately 
because there are different requirements imposed to them. For $e\mu$ triggers, 
we assume that the efficiency of both legs can be modelled by measurements 
of per leg efficiency of double-electon and double-muon triggers.%[\textcolor{red}{ref?}] 
This assumption was validated by measuring $e\mu$ trigger efficiency 
using \Top\Atop~events with MET $>$ 20 GeV. In order to avoid possible bias,
the muon leg efficiency was measured using events passing single-electron triggers
and the electron leg efficiency was measured using events passing single-muon triggers.
The result turned out to be consistent with our model using per leg efficiency
from measurements of double-lepton trigger within statistical uncertainties. 

Using the per leg efficiency of the double-lepton triggers and the single-lepton triggers, 
the per event trigger efficiency is calculated. The requirement of the 
single-lepton trigger is tighter than the requirements applied to each leg in 
double-lepton trigger. 
So, there are only three cases where an event passes the trigger requirements. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Both leptons pass the requirement on each leg in the double-lepton trigger and dZ 
\item Both leptons pass the requirement on each leg in the double-lepton trigger, 
      but failed dZ. 
      At least one of the leptons pass the single-lepton trigger.
\item One of the leptons fails the double-lepton trigger requirements, 
      but the other lepton passes the single-lepton trigger.
\end{enumerate}
As mentioned above, dZ efficiency is assumed to be 100 \% in our calculation, 
so (2) is not included in the per event efficiency calculation.

Figure \ref{fig:trg_eff_diagram} shows the failing cases of the double-lepton trigger. 
Online, there are three cases for each lepton : passing leading leg requirement(L), 
passing trailing lepton requirement(T), and passing none of them(F). 
There are 9($3\times3$) possible combinations in total, of which there are 6 cases 
where the trigger fails. The category 1(4 combinations) is the case where none of the 
two leptons pass the leading leg requirement. The category 2 and 3 are the cases where one 
lepton passes the leading leg requirement, but the other leg fails the trailing leg 
requirement. Converting this into an equation, we have 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:doubletrgeff}
\epsilon_{double-lepton} \left( p_{T1},\eta_1,p_{T2},\eta_2 \right)
&=&    
1 - \Big[   \\ 
& & 
\underbrace{
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right)
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right)  
}_\text{catetory 1} \\
& & 
+ \underbrace{
\epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right)
}_\text{catetory 2} \\
& &
+ \underbrace{
\epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right) 
}_\text{catetory 3}
\,\, \Big]
\end{eqnarray} 
where $p_{T1(2)} \textrm{ and } \eta_{1(2)}$ are \pt~and \Eta~of offline leptons, 
$\epsilon_{DL}$($\epsilon_{DT}$) is the efficiency for the leading(trailing) leg 
of the double-lepton trigger. 
Each term corresponds to the 3 categories in Figure \ref{fig:trg_eff_diagram}.
In case the double-lepton trigger fails because one of the legs fails, the other leg 
which passed double-lepton trigger requirement might pass the single lepton trigger. 
This way, inefficiency of double-lepton trigger can be recovered by the single-lepton trigger.
The recovery of efficiency by the single-lepton trigger is  
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:singletrgeff}
\epsilon_{single-lepton} \left( p_{T1},\eta_1,p_{T2},\eta_2 \right)
&=&    
\underbrace{
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right)
\epsilon_{S}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)  
}_\text{catetory 4} \\
& & 
+ \underbrace{
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right)
\epsilon_{S}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)  
}_\text{catetory 5} 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\epsilon_{S}$ is the efficiency of the single-lepton trigger. 
Therefore, the total per-event trigger efficiency is given by 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\label{eq:doubletrgeff}
\epsilon_{event} \left( p_{T1},\eta_1,p_{T2},\eta_2 \right)
&=&    
1 - \Big[    
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right)
\left(1 - \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right)  \\ 
& & 
+ \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right) \\
& &
+ \epsilon_{DL}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right)  
\Big] \\
& &
+ \left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)\right)
\epsilon_{S}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)  \\ 
& & 
+ \left(1 - \epsilon_{DT}\left(p_{T2}, \eta_2\right)\right)
\epsilon_{S}\left(p_{T1}, \eta_1\right)  
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Jet Counting Efficiency} 

%The analysis is optimized for different categories of number of jets. 
%But, jet counting efficiency which is defined as 
%$\displaystyle  \epsilon_{0/1} = \frac{N_{njet=0/1}}{N_{njet\geq0}}$ 
%can be different in simulation and data.  
%So, we correct the efficiency of \hww~in MC by a data-to-MC scale 
%factor measured in MC and data using \dyll~events.  

The jet counting efficiency of \hww~events($\epsilon_{\hww}$) 
is calculated by 
\begin{eqnarray} 
\epsilon_{\hww} 
= \epsilon_{\hww}^{MC} \times \frac{\epsilon_{\dyll}^{Data}}{\epsilon_{\dyll}^{MC}}  
\end{eqnarray} 
where $\epsilon_{\hww}^{MC}$ is the jet counting efficiency of \hww~in simulation, 
and $\frac{\epsilon_{\dyll}^{Data}}{\epsilon_{\dyll}^{MC}}$
is the data/simulation scale factor measured using \dyll~events.
The efficiencies of \dyll~events are evaluated using Drell-Yan events with  
dilepton mass within 7.5 GeV of the Z peak.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Figure \ref{fig:znjets} shows the distribution of the number of jets for data and MC. 
In all bins a good agreement with difference less than 1~\% is observed. 

The systematic uncertainty to jet counting efficiency comes from the statistics 
when measuring the data/simulation scale factor and the theoretical uncertainty of jet 
counting in imulation. The former is less than 1~\% being negligible 
compared to the theoretical uncertainty which is at the level of 15~\%. 
This uncertainty will be discussed in detail in chapter~\ref{ch:systematics}. 

Figure \ref{fig:jetveto_z} shows the \pt~distribution of the leading jet(left) 
and the jet veto effciency as a function of the leading jet \pt(right).
With the jet \pt~threshold 30 \GeV, the agreement between data and MC is very good. 
Figure \ref{fig:jetfrac_z} shows fraction of events with 0-jet and 
1-jet as a function of the number of recontructed vertexes($N_{vtx}$). 
Data and MC show very good agreement.
The dependence on $N_{vtx}$ is small in both data and simulation.
Thus, with the chosen jet idenfication, the jet counting efficiency 
is not affected by the pileup correction.
