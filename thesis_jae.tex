% KNOWN ISSUES:
%
%   Currently only the 12pt size conforms to the UCSD requirements.
%   The 10pt and 11pt options make the footnote fonts too small.

% More control of the formatting of your thesis can be achieved through
% modifications of the included LaTeX class files:
%
%   * ucsd.cls    -- Class file
%   * uct10.clo   -- Configuration files for font sizes 10pt, 11pt, 12pt
%     uct11.clo                            
%     uct12.clo

% Setup the documentclass 
% default options: 12pt, oneside, final
%
% fonts: 10pt, 11pt, 12pt -- are valid for UCSD dissertations.
% sides: oneside, twoside -- note that two-sided theses are not accepted 
%                            by OGS.
% mode: draft, final      -- draft mode switches to single spacing, 
%                            removes hyperlinks, and places a black box
%                            at every overfull hbox (check these before
%                            submission).
% chapterheads            -- Include this if you want your chapters to read:
%                              Chapter 1
%                              Title of Chapter
%
%                            instead of
%                              1 Title of Chapter
\documentclass[12pt,chapterheads]{ucsd}



% Include all packages you need here.  
% Some standard options are suggested below.
%
% See the project wiki for information on how to use 
% these packages. Other useful packages are also listed there.
%
%   http://code.google.com/p/ucsd-thesis/wiki/GettingStarted



\usepackage{amsmath, amscd, amssymb, amsthm}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}

%% TIMES FONT - replacements for Computer Modern
%%   This package will replace the default font with a
%%   Times-Roman font with math support.
% \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
% \usepackage{mathptmx}

%% INDEX
%   Uncomment the following two lines to create an index: 
 \usepackage{makeidx}
 \makeindex
%   You will need to uncomment the \printindex line near the
%   bibliography to display the index.  Use the command
% \index{keyword} 
%   within the text to create an entry in the index for keyword.
%   To compile a LaTeX document with an index the 'makeindex'
%   command will need to be run.  See the wiki for more details.

%% HYPERLINKS
%   To create a PDF with hyperlinks, you need to include the hyperref package.
%   THIS HAS TO BE THE LAST PACKAGE INCLUDED!
%   Note that the options plainpages=false and pdfpagelabels exist
%   to fix indexing associated with having both (ii) and (2) as pages.
%   Also, all links must be black according to OGS.
%   See: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=hyperdupdest
%   Note: This may not work correctly with all DVI viewers (i.e. Yap breaks).
%   NOTE: hyperref will NOT work in draft mode, as noted above.
% \usepackage[colorlinks=true, pdfstartview=FitV, 
%             linkcolor=black, citecolor=black, 
%             urlcolor=black, plainpages=false,
%             pdfpagelabels]{hyperref}
% \hypersetup{ pdfauthor = {Your Name Here}, 
%              pdftitle = {The Title of The Dissertation}, 
%              pdfkeywords = {Keywords for Searching}, 
%              pdfcreator = {pdfLaTeX with hyperref package}, 
%              pdfproducer = {pdfLaTeX} }
